This allows querying/retrieving all notes for a user. \\n\\n- It has a reference to an optional UsersInfo object. This is a separate entity that stores additional user profile/info details.\\n\\n- The Notes and UserInfo properties use virtual to enable lazy loading in an ORM like Entity Framework.\\n\\n- It defines the core user data needed to represent and work with users in the system, and link them to related note and profile data.\\n\\nIn summary, the key functions of this file/class are:\\n\\n- Define the user entity/model \\n- Store user identifying/authentication fields\\n- Link a user to their notes and additional profile info\\n- Enable relationships in an ORM for querying related data\\n\\nSo in essence it models the user data and relationships needed for the diary application functionality.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/DependencyInjection.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This DependencyInjection.cs file is setting up dependency injection for the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nThe key things it is doing:\\n\\n1. Adding MVC Controllers support to the services collection with AddControllers(). This allows controllers to be resolved via dependency injection.\\n\\n2. Configuring JSON serialization options to ignore reference cycles. This prevents issues serializing objects with cyclic references to JSON. \\n\\n3. Adding SignalR support via AddSignalR(). This enables real-time functionality using SignalR.\\n\\n4. Adding CORS support via AddCors(). This allows cross-origin requests from client-side apps.\\n\\n5. The AddPresentation extension method encapsulates all these setup steps related to the presentation/API layer into a reusable extension method.\\n\\nSo in summary, it is wiring up the necessary services and middleware for building an ASP.NET Core API project with MVC controllers, JSON serialization, real-time capabilities via SignalR, and cross-origin support via CORS. This sets the foundation for the project\\u0027s dependency injection and presentation layer configuration.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Interfaces/Persistence/IUserRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for a user repository in the persistence layer.\\n\\nThe IUserRepository interface:\\n\\n- Defines functions for interacting with Users entities in a data store.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Add(Users users) - Adds a new user to the data store\\n- GetByLogin(string login) - Gets a user by their login \\n- GetByUserId(Guid userId) - Gets a user by their user ID\\n- IsLoginExist(string login) - Checks if a login already exists in the data store\\n\\nThe purpose of this interface is to abstract the data access logic for users away from the application layer. Any class that implements this interface can then be used to retrieve, add, and query user data without the application layer needing to know the specific data store implementation.\\n\\nThis allows the persistence layer to be decoupled and easily swapped out or changed without affecting the application code. The application only interacts with the interface, not the concrete implementation.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231024130135_Initial.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a class called Initial that inherits from Migration. It is used to define the initial database schema/structure for an Entity Framework Core project.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Up method:\\n  - Defines the CreateTable operations to create the database tables\\n  - Defines primary keys and foreign key constraints\\n- Down method: \\n  - Defines the reverse operations to drop the tables, in case we want to rollback the migration\\n\\nIn summary, this migration file:\\n\\n- Defines the initial database schema on application startup \\n- Creates all the necessary tables\\n- Establishes relationships between tables through primary/foreign keys\\n- Provides a way to rollback the changes if needed\\n\\nSo in one file it handles both creating and optionally dropping the database structure for the initial state of the data model. This allows Entity Framework to manage the database schema and handle schema migrations over time as the data model changes.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/obj/Debug/net7.0/.NETCoreApp,Version\\u003dv7.0.AssemblyAttributes.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an assembly attributes file generated by the .NET compiler.\\n\\nIt contains metadata attributes that are applied to the assembly. The main purpose of this file is to specify the target framework for the assembly.\\n\\nKey functions/attributes:\\n\\n- TargetFrameworkAttribute - Specifies that the target framework for the assembly is .NET Core 7.0. This informs other code/tools which version of .NET the assembly is compiled for.\\n\\n- FrameworkDisplayName - Provides a human-readable name for the target framework, in this case \\\&quot;.NET 7.0\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- Assembly attributes in general provide metadata about the assembly that can be read at runtime via reflection. This includes things like assembly name, version, copyright etc. \\n\\n- The attributes in this file don\\u0027t contain any code - they just annotate the assembly with metadata. This file is generated automatically by the compiler and isn\\u0027t intended to be edited directly.\\n\\nSo in summary, it specifies the target framework for reflection and allows other code to identify which .NET version the assembly was compiled for. This provides metadata about the assembly.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Persistence/Repositories/NoteRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines the NoteRepository class which implements the INoteRepository interface. It is responsible for performing CRUD operations on Notes entities in the database.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Add - Adds a new Note entity to the database\\n- Update - Updates an existing Note by id \\n- GetById - Gets a Note by its id\\n- GetAllByUser - Gets all Notes associated with a specific user id\\n\\nThe repository interacts with the DiaryDbContext to perform database operations. It abstracts the data access layer so that client code only needs to work with the repository interfaces rather than directly with Entity Framework.\\n\\nSome key points:\\n\\n- Implements INoteRepository interface \\n- Has a private DiaryDbContext injected via constructor\\n- Defines async CRUD methods for Notes\\n- Uses DbSet on DiaryDbContext to query/save Note entities\\n- Provides a common way to access/manipulate Note data\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a clean interface and implementation for data access of Note entities via the database context.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025122721_add tags and relationships.Designer.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a migration file for Entity Framework Core. It is used to manage changes to the database schema.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- BuildTargetModel - This method builds the target model based on the migrations.

Specifies properties, keys, indexes etc.\\n\\n- HasKey - Defines the primary key for an entity. \\n\\n- HasIndex - Defines indexes on properties.\\n\\n- ToTable - Maps an entity class to a database table. \\n\\n- HasOne/WithOne - Defines one-to-one relationships between entities.\\n\\n- HasMany/WithMany - Defines one-to-many relationships between entities. \\n\\n- HasForeignKey - Defines foreign key properties.\\n\\n- OnDelete - Specifies cascade delete behavior for relationships.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the database schema using Entity Framework migrations based on the domain model changes introduced in this migration.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Commands/Delete/DeleteNoteCommandHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a handler for the DeleteNoteCommand command in the MediatR CQRS/ES pattern.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Implements the IRequestHandler interface for the DeleteNoteCommand command\\n- Has dependencies on the INoteRepository and IUnitOfWork interfaces for data access\\n- Handle method that gets called when the command is dispatched\\n  - Finds the note entity to delete using the note ID from the command\\n  - Deletes the note entity from the note repository\\n  - Saves the changes to the database by calling SaveChanges on the unit of work\\n\\nIn summary, it handles executing the deletion of a note entity from the database when the DeleteNoteCommand is dispatched, using the note repository and unit of work to perform the data access/persistence operations. It implements the command handler for deleting a note as part of the CQRS/ES pattern.\&quot;,\&quot;/calendar.md\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines the data model for a calendar application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines the main entities/objects in the application:\\n  - User - Represents a registered user\\n  - UserInfo - Additional profile information for a user\\n  - Calendar - Represents a calendar belonging to a user\\n  - Note - Represents a note/event that can be added to a calendar\\n\\n- It defines the properties of each entity, including identifiers, relationships between entities, and other metadata.\\n\\n- The JSON examples show sample data for each entity.\\n\\n- The C# classes define the data model/object structure that would be used in code.\\n\\n- Key functions/capabilities implied:\\n  - User authentication/registration \\n  - User profiles with additional info\\n  - Ability for users to create multiple calendars\\n  - Calendars can contain notes/events\\n  - Notes have content and are associated with a calendar/user\\n\\nSo in summary, this file defines the core data model and relationships that would power a calendar/scheduling application where users can create profiles, calendars, and add notes/events to their calendars. The C# classes could be used by the backend code to work with and persist this data.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/Controllers/UsersController.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines the UsersController for the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nIt is responsible for handling requests related to users.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Handles requests at the /users route\\n- Constructor injects dependencies like the mediator and user repository\\n- Has an action method GetIsLoginExist that handles GET requests to /users/isLoginExist/{login}\\n- This action method sends an IsLoginExistQuery to the mediator, passing the login parameter\\n- The query will be handled by the IsLoginExistQueryHandler to check if the login exists\\n- It returns the response from the query back to the caller\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines the UsersController \\n- Handles user related requests\\n- Has an action to check if a login exists via MediatR query/handler\\n- Injects dependencies \\n- Returns response from query\\n\\nIt provides an API endpoint to check login existence using CQRS/MediatR pattern for separation of concerns.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/Note/Notes.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This Notes.cs file defines the Note entity for the Diary domain model.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a Notes class to represent a note object\\n- It has properties for the note id, name, content, create date, user id\\n- The user id property links it to a User entity \\n- It has a navigation property to a collection of Tag entities\\n- It uses entity framework conventions like public properties and default constructor\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines the data structure and properties of a note \\n- Links a note to a user via the user id foreign key\\n- Allows a note to have many tags via the tags navigation property\\n- Implements entity framework patterns to allow CRUD operations on notes\\n- Represents the note entity that can be queried, inserted, updated in the database\\n\\nSo in summary, this class defines the core note entity that represents a note object and its relationships within the domain model.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/obj/project.assets.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a project.assets.json file generated by the .NET SDK. It contains metadata about the dependencies and assets for a .NET project.\\n\\nSome key functions of this file:\\n\\n- Defines the target frameworks and dependencies for the project (e.g. net7.0)\\n- Lists all package and project references and their versions\\n- Tracks the files and assets for each package/project reference \\n- Stores information about the project restore process like packages paths, sources, etc.\\n- Defines the dependency graph between frameworks and dependencies\\n- Helps the SDK determine what needs to be restored/built by tracking assets\\n\\nIn summary, it provides a centralized location for the SDK to track all information about a project\\u0027s dependencies and assets. This allows it to efficiently restore, build and deploy the project without needing to re-evaluate the dependency graph on each operation. It acts as a cache of metadata.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Persistence/UnitOfWork.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file implements the IUnitOfWork interface and provides a unit of work pattern for the application\\u0027s data access layer.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Implements the SaveChangesAsync method from IUnitOfWork. This saves any pending changes to the underlying database context.\\n\\n- Stores a reference to the DiaryDbContext which represents the database. All data access will go through this context. \\n\\n- Constructor injects the DiaryDbContext so it is available to call SaveChangesAsync on.\\n\\nThe main purpose is to coordinate data access and caching of entities across repositories. Any changes to entities can be committed or rolled back together as a single unit of work. This follows the repository pattern by abstracting the data access behind interfaces.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231026220146_update.Designer.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an auto-generated designer file for an Entity Framework Core migration.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- BuildTargetModel - This method builds the target model for the migration by configuring the entity types and relationships.\\n\\n- It configures the entity properties like primary keys, data types, max lengths, required fields etc. \\n\\n- It establishes the relationships between entities using HasOne, WithMany etc. \\n\\n- It configures cascade deletes and foreign key properties.\\n\\n- It sets up indexes on properties.\\n\\n- It sets up default values for properties.\\n\\n- It defines navigation properties to represent relationships between entities.\\n\\nSo in summary, this file defines the target database model that the migration will update the database to.

The compiler uses it to understand the intended namespaces for unqualified types.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/User/Queries/IsLoginExist/IsLoginExistQueryHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a query handler class for the IsLoginExist query in the Diary.Application User queries project.\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- IsLoginExistQueryHandler implements the IRequestHandler interface for the IsLoginExistQuery message type. This allows it to handle queries of that type.\\n\\n- It takes an IUserRepository in the constructor for data access. \\n\\n- The Handle method gets called when an IsLoginExistQuery is received. It calls the IsLoginExist method on the user repository, passing the login from the query, to check if that login already exists. \\n\\n- IsLoginExist on the repository returns a bool indicating if the login exists or not. \\n\\n- This returns the result to the caller to indicate if the login passed in the query is already in use.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructor - Initializes the user repository dependency\\n- Handle - Main handler method that calls the repository and returns the result\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides the query handling logic to check if a login already exists by delegating to the user repository data access layer.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Authentication/Commands/Register/RegisterCommand.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a command for registering a new user in the application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a RegisterCommand class that inherits from IRequest\\u003cAuthenticationResult\\u003e. This means it is a MediatR command that will return an AuthenticationResult object.\\n\\n- The RegisterCommand class has properties for the login, password, email, first name and last name of the user being registered. \\n\\n- When executed via MediatR, this command will trigger the registration process - it likely calls a user registration service which will hash the password, save the user details to the database, and return an AuthenticationResult with things like an auth token.\\n\\n- The AuthenticationResult return type indicates this command is for authentication/authorization purposes - registering a user so they can then authenticate.\\n\\n- It is in the Authentication.Commands.Register namespace, showing it is a command related to the registration process of the authentication system.\\n\\nSo in summary, this defines a command object that can be used to trigger the user registration process via MediatR, providing the required user details, and returning an authentication result like a token.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This DependencyInjection.cs file configures the dependency injection for the infrastructure layer in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- AddInfrastructure(): Adds authentication and persistence services to the DI container.\\n\\n- AddPersistence(): Adds Entity Framework Core services for the PostgreSQL database context and repositories.\\n\\n- AddAuth(): Configures JWT authentication services like the token generator and password hasher. Also configures JWT bearer authentication in ASP.NET Core.\\n\\n- It registers the necessary interfaces and classes for authentication, persistence and other infrastructure services. This includes database context, repositories, unit of work, JWT token generator, password hasher etc. \\n\\n- It configures the PostgreSQL database connection string. \\n\\n- It configures JWT authentication options like issuer, audience, secret from the appsettings.json configuration.\\n\\nIn summary, it wires up all the infrastructure services and dependencies used by the application layers like data access, authentication etc. This allows these services to be injected and used throughout the application.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/Controllers/ApiController.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an ApiController base class that other API controllers can inherit from.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Marks the controller as an API controller with the [ApiController] attribute.\\n\\n- Defines a protected GetUserId() method that extracts the user ID from the JWT token in the Authorization header.\\n\\n  - It splits the Authorization header value on space to get the token\\n  - Creates a JwtSecurityToken from the token\\n  - Extracts the subject (sub) claim value from the payload, which contains the user ID\\n\\n- GetUserId() is protected so child controllers can call it to get the authenticated user ID.\\n\\n- It uses the [Authorize] attribute so any actions in child controllers using this base class will require authentication.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a base API controller \\n- Extracts user ID from JWT token\\n- Child controllers can access user ID via GetUserId()\\n- Requires authentication for any actions\\n\\nThis provides a common way to get the authenticated user across API controllers and ensures authentication is required.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Api.GlobalUsings.g.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an auto-generated file that defines global usings for namespaces in the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It is generated automatically by the .NET tooling based on the namespaces used in the project.\\n\\n- The \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directives make namespaces available throughout the project without needing to explicitly import them in each file. \\n\\n- It includes common ASP.NET Core namespaces like Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting, etc. that are likely needed project-wide.\\n\\n- It also includes common System namespaces like System, System.Collections.Generic, System.Linq, etc. \\n\\n- Adding or removing namespaces from actual code files will cause this file to be regenerated with updates global usings.\\n\\nSo in summary, the key functions of this file are:\\n\\n- Define global namespaces that are available everywhere in the project\\n- Reduce boilerplate code by not needing explicit imports in each file\\n- Get auto-updated when namespace usage changes elsewhere in the codebase\\n\\nIt helps clean up code by centralizing commonly used namespace imports in one place.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Note/UpdateNote.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a record type for updating a note in the diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the Diary.Application.Common.Note namespace. This indicates it is part of the common/shared code for working with notes.\\n\\n- UpdateNote is defined as a record type. Records in C# are immutable data structures, similar to classes but with value semantics. \\n\\n- No properties are defined on the UpdateNote record. This implies it is just a marker/envelope for the update note operation, and the actual note properties/values would be passed separately, likely as parameters to methods that accept an UpdateNote.\\n\\n- Some key functions this would enable:\\n\\n  - Updating an existing note by passing an UpdateNote record and new note values to a method\\n\\n  - Validating an UpdateNote record before allowing the update to occur\\n\\n  - Logging/auditing note updates by capturing the UpdateNote that triggered them\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a type for representing a note update operation, without specifying the actual note property values. This allows methods/services to accept update requests in a standardized way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Commands/Update/UpdateNoteCommand.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a command for updating a note in the diary application using MediatR.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- UpdateNoteCommand is a record (immutable class) that defines the data needed for the command - the note ID, name, and content. \\n\\n- It implements IRequest\\u003cNotes\\u003e to indicate it is a request that will return a Notes object.\\n\\n- This is a command class defined to be handled by MediatR. Commands in MediatR trigger side effects like database updates.\\n\\n- When an instance of UpdateNoteCommand is sent to the Mediator, it will be handled by a command handler that will perform the database/repository update logic.\\n\\n- The handler will update the note with the given ID with the new name and content values passed in. \\n\\n- It will then return the updated Notes entity/aggregate from the database context.\\n\\nSo in summary, its key functions are:\\n\\n1. Define the data payload for the update note command\\n2. Indicate it is a request handled by MediatR \\n3. Trigger the note update logic in a command handler\\n4. Return the updated note entity\\n\\nIt provides a clean way to encapsulate the note update operation using CQRS/MediatR patterns.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Persistence/Repositories/TagRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a TagRepository class that is used to interact with the database for Tag entities.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is in the Persistence/Repositories namespace, indicating it is a data access repository class.\\n\\n- It has a constructor that accepts a DiaryDbContext, which is the DbContext used to connect to the database. This context is stored in a private field.\\n\\n- No other methods are defined, but this is intended to be the starting point for common CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods for Tag entities:\\n\\n  - GetTag() \\n  - GetTags()\\n  - AddTag()\\n  - UpdateTag()\\n  - DeleteTag()\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a repository class for Tag entities\\n- It establishes a connection to the database context \\n- It provides a starting point to add CRUD methods for working with Tag data in the database\\n\\nThe purpose is to encapsulate data access logic and provide a clean interface to work with Tag entities via common repository patterns and patterns.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Authentication/PasswordHasher.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file implements the IPasswordHasher interface from the Diary.Application.Common.Interfaces.Authentication namespace.\\n\\nIt provides password hashing functionality using the BCrypt algorithm.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- GeneratePassword(string password) - Hashes the given password using BCrypt and returns the hashed password string.\\n\\n- VerifyPassword(string password, string passwordHash) - Verifies that the given password matches the hashed password using BCrypt and returns a boolean.\\n\\nThe purpose of this class is to securely hash passwords when storing them in the database, and verify passwords during login by comparing the hashed password to a hashed version of the entered password without revealing the original password. This helps protect user passwords if the database is ever compromised.\\n\\nBy implementing the IPasswordHasher interface, it provides a reusable password hashing service that can be injected where needed, keeping password logic centralized in one place.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025122721_add tags and relationships.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a migration for the Diary.Infrastructure database context in an Entity Framework Core project.\\n\\nMigrations in EF Core are used to modify the database schema over time as the domain model changes. This particular migration is adding tags and relationships between tags and notes.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Renames tables and columns to match new naming conventions \\n- Adds primary keys to tables\\n- Creates new Tag and TagNote tables\\n- Defines relationships between tables via foreign keys\\n- Handles renaming/recreating indexes\\n\\nThe Up() method handles applying the migration - adding new tables/columns, renaming things, defining relationships. \\n\\nThe Down() method undoes the changes, reversing what was done in Up(). This allows rolling back the migration if needed.\\n\\nSo in summary, this migration file:\\n\\n- Modifies the database schema to support tags and tag-note relationships\\n- Handles renaming/renaming columns, tables, indexes to match changes\\n- Defines primary keys and foreign key relationships between tables\\n\\nIt allows evolving the database structure over time in a managed way using EF Core migrations.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/bin/Debug/net7.0/appsettings.json\&quot;:\&quot;This appsettings.json file contains configuration settings for the Diary.Api project in .NET.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Configures logging levels - sets the default log level to Information and Microsoft.AspNetCore logs to Warning level. This controls the verbosity of logging output.\\n\\n- Sets AllowedHosts to *, which allows requests from any host for development purposes. This relaxes security. \\n\\n- Contains JWT (JSON Web Token) settings for authentication:\\n\\n  - Secret - The secret key used to sign JWTs \\n  - ExpiryMinutes - How long JWTs remain valid before expiring\\n  - Issuer - Identifies the issuer of the JWT\\n  - Audience - Identifies the intended recipients of the JWT\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n- Configures logging\\n- Sets allowed hosts for development \\n- Defines JWT authentication settings like secret, expiry and claims\\n\\nThis allows the API project to be configured via code for things like logging, security and authentication without having to modify code directly. The settings can then be changed without a redeploy.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/Hubs/NotesHub.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a SignalR hub class called NotesHub that handles real-time communication for notes.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Implements the Hub base class from SignalR to enable real-time functionality\\n- Injects an ISender mediator via dependency injection to allow publishing events\\n- Has an AddGroupNotes method that adds the connected client to a group based on the user ID passed in\\n- Uses the Groups property on the hub context to add the client to a group using AddToGroupAsync\\n- This allows pushing notifications to all clients in a user\\u0027s group when notes for that user change\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructor injects the ISender mediator \\n- AddGroupNotes method adds the client connection to a group based on user ID\\n- Uses Groups property and AddToGroupAsync to manage client groups for pushing real-time updates\\n- No other methods defined yet, but this allows adding methods later to publish events via the mediator\\n\\nSo in summary, it sets up the basic SignalR functionality and group management to enable real-time note updates by user group.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231024211636_user update (login unique).cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a database migration for the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Adds a migration called \\\&quot;user update (login unique)\\\&quot;\\n\\n- The Up method:\\n  - Creates a unique index on the \\\&quot;login\\\&quot; column of the \\\&quot;user\\\&quot; table. This ensures each login value is unique.\\n\\n- The Down method:\\n  - Drops the index that was created in the Up method. This allows reverting the migration if needed.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It\\u0027s a database migration file\\n- The migration adds a unique index to enforce unique login values in the users table \\n- Up method adds the index\\n- Down method removes the index, allowing rollback of the migration\\n\\nThe purpose is to modify the database schema/structure by adding the unique index constraint to the users table through a migration. This helps manage database schema changes in a repeatable way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/Note/NoteUpdateRequest.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a request model for updating a note in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined as a record type, which makes it immutable.\\n\\n- NoteUpdateRequest accepts 3 parameters:\\n\\n  - NoteId - The ID of the note to update\\n\\n  - Content - The updated content of the note (nullable)\\n\\n  - Name - The updated name of the note (nullable)\\n\\n- This defines the shape of the data that needs to be passed when making a request to update a note. The ID is required to identify which note to update, while the content and name are optional fields that can be updated.\\n\\n- It acts as a data transfer object (DTO) - it defines the contract for what data needs to be sent in an update request without any application logic.\\n\\n- Key functions:\\n\\n  - Defines a standard request format for updating a note\\n\\n  - Makes the required/optional fields explicit\\n\\n  - Ensures requests are immutable/well-defined\\n\\n  - Acts as a contract between the client and API for note updates\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a request model that clients can use to send updated note data to the API in a standardized, immutable way for processing the update.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/Authentication/RegisterRequest.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a request model for user registration in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the Diary.Contracts.Authentication namespace, indicating it is related to authentication.\\n\\n- RegisterRequest is a record type, which is a lightweight data class in C#.\\n\\n- It defines the properties needed to register a new user:\\n\\n  - Login - The username \\n  - Password \\n  - Email\\n  - FirstName\\n  - LastName\\n\\n- This model class is used to define the expected shape/properties of the data needed to register a new user. The controller/service would accept an instance of this class as a parameter.\\n\\n- It allows strong typing of the registration request data, rather than using a loose dictionary or dynamic object. \\n\\n- Provides validation of required properties being present on registration requests.\\n\\n- Helps map registration request data to an entity/database model for storage.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the contract/shape for user registration requests received by the API in a strongly typed way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Application.GlobalUsings.g.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an auto-generated file that defines global usings for the Diary.Application project in .NET.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It has the \\u003cauto-generated/\\u003e tag which indicates it is auto-generated and not meant to be manually edited.\\n\\n- It defines a set of \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directives for commonly used namespaces in the project. This avoids having to explicitly specify the namespaces everywhere they are used.\\n\\n- The namespaces included are things like System, System.Collections.Generic, System.IO, System.Linq etc. These contain common data types, collections, I/O functionality etc. that are likely to be used throughout the project. \\n\\n- By defining these as \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directives, types from these namespaces can be used directly without specifying the namespace prefix. For example List instead of System.Collections.Generic.List.\\n\\n- This helps reduce verbosity in the code and makes the code cleaner by avoiding repeated namespace qualifications.\\n\\n- The file is generated at build/compile time based on configurations to ensure all projects have a consistent set of global usings defined.\\n\\nSo in summary, the key function of this file is to define global using directives for common namespaces to improve code readability and reduce verbosity by allowing direct usage of types without namespace qualifications.

It uses the note repository interface to abstract data access away from the handler.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231026220146_update.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a migration for updating the database schema in an Entity Framework Core project.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Drops the foreign key constraint between the Note table and the Calendar table.\\n\\n- Drops the Calendar table. \\n\\n- Renames the CalendarId column in the Note table to UserId. \\n\\n- Renames the index on the Note table that was on the CalendarId column to be on the new UserId column.\\n\\n- Adds a new foreign key constraint between the Note table and the User table on the UserId column, with a cascade delete behavior.\\n\\nSo in summary, it is removing the relationship between notes and calendars, and instead relating each note directly to a user. This changes the data model/schema.\\n\\nThe Up and Down methods allow applying and reverting these changes - Up runs the schema altering code, Down undoes it. This allows incremental deployment of database changes with migrations.\\n\\nSo the key functions are:\\n\\n- Altering the database schema through actions like dropping/adding tables, columns, constraints\\n- Providing a reversible set of changes via Up/Down methods for migrations\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Interfaces/Persistence/INoteRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for a note repository in the persistence layer.\\n\\nThe key functions it defines are:\\n\\n- Add(Notes note) - Adds a new note to the data store\\n- Update(Guid noteId, string? name, string? content) - Updates an existing note by ID \\n- GetById(Guid noteId) - Gets a note by its ID\\n- GetAllByUser(Guid userId) - Gets all notes for a given user ID\\n\\nSome key points:\\n\\n- It is in the Common/Interfaces/Persistence folder, indicating it defines an interface for a persistence layer implementation\\n- It references the Notes domain model class from the Domain project\\n- All methods are asynchronous Task-based methods\\n- The interface defines the basic CRUD operations for notes - Add, Update, GetById, GetAll\\n- This allows different data store implementations (SQL, NoSQL etc) to be plugged in via implementing this interface\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a standard interface for a note data access layer that different data store implementations can implement to provide a consistent way of working with note entities.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Domain.AssemblyInfo.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file (Diary.Domain.AssemblyInfo.cs) contains assembly level attributes for the Diary.Domain assembly.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Provides metadata about the assembly such as company name, product name, version, etc. This metadata is used at runtime.\\n\\n- AssemblyCompanyAttribute specifies the name of the company that produced the assembly.\\n\\n- AssemblyConfigurationAttribute specifies the configuration (e.g. Debug) for the assembly. \\n\\n- AssemblyFileVersionAttribute and AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute specify the file and informational version numbers of the assembly.\\n\\n- AssemblyProductAttribute specifies the name of the product that this assembly is a part of.\\n\\n- AssemblyTitleAttribute specifies the title of the assembly. \\n\\n- AssemblyVersionAttribute specifies the version number of the assembly.\\n\\n- The attributes are used by tools like NuGet to identify the assembly and by the runtime to load the correct assembly.\\n\\n- The file is auto-generated and contains boilerplate code to set the assembly level attributes. It shouldn\\u0027t be manually edited.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides metadata about the assembly for identification and versioning purposes mainly used by tools and runtime.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/Authentication/LoginRequest.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a LoginRequest class that represents a request to log in to the system.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the Diary.Contracts.Authentication namespace, indicating it is related to authentication.\\n\\n- It is a record class, meaning it is immutable and the properties are read-only.\\n\\n- It has two string properties - Login and Password - to represent the login credentials being passed in the request. \\n\\n- LoginRequest is likely used as a parameter type for an authentication service method that handles login requests. The service would validate the credentials and return a result/token if valid.\\n\\n- By defining it as a separate class, the request payload is decoupled from the implementation of the authentication logic. This follows separation of concerns.\\n\\n- It lives in the Contracts project/namespace, so other projects can reference this type to make strongly typed login requests without direct dependency on the authentication implementation.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines an immutable data transfer object to represent a login request payload in a way that is reusable across different projects/layers in a decoupled manner.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/bin/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Application.deps.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a dependencies.json file that contains information about the dependencies of the Diary.Application project.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines the runtime target (.NET Core 7.0)\\n- Lists the direct dependencies of the Diary.Application project (Diary.Contracts, Diary.Domain, MediatR, etc.)\\n- Provides information about each dependency, including:\\n  - Its own dependencies\\n  - The assembly files it contains\\n- Distinguishes between project references and package references\\n- Provides metadata like assembly and file versions for each package\\n- Allows restoring the full dependency graph of the application\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines the project\\u0027s dependency graph \\n- Enables dependency restoration/installation\\n- Provides metadata about each dependency \\n- Distinguishes project vs package references\\n- Supports diagnosing dependency/versioning issues\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the information needed to understand and restore the dependencies of the Diary.Application project.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/DependencyInjection.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is setting up dependency injection for the Diary.Application project.\\n\\nThe key things it is doing:\\n\\n1.

Scanning the assembly (the current assembly where this class is defined) and registering any classes that implement IRequestHandler or IRequestPreProcessor interfaces with MediatR. This allows any command/query handlers to be automatically discovered and registered.\\n\\n3. Returning the services collection so that the configuration can be added to the main DI container in the composition root of the application.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Sets up MediatR for handling commands/queries\\n- Automatically discovers and registers command/query handlers \\n- Returns services collection for composition root\\n\\nThis sets up all the plumbing needed for MediatR and command/query handling within this layer of the application in a clean, automatic way via dependency injection.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Profile/Queries/GetProfile/GetProfileQueryHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains the handler for the GetProfileQuery MediatR query in the Diary.Application.Profile.Queries.GetProfile namespace.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Handles the GetProfileQuery request and returns a ProfileResult object\\n- Retrieves the user object from the IUserRepository using the userId from the request\\n- Retrieves the user info object from the IUserInfoRepository using the same userId  \\n- Constructs and returns a ProfileResult containing the user\\u0027s login, email, first name and last name\\n- Throws an exception if either the user or user info objects are null\\n\\nIn summary, it handles the query to get a user\\u0027s profile details by coordinating retrieval of data from the user and user info repositories and assembling it into a ProfileResult response object.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/obj/project.packagespec.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a project.packagespec.json file that is generated by the .NET SDK to store NuGet package restore information for a project.\\n\\nSome key things it does/contains:\\n\\n- Stores restore metadata for the project, including the project path, output path, style (PackageReference), fallback folders, target frameworks, and NuGet package sources.\\n\\n- Defines the frameworks supported by the project (in this case just .NET 7.0) and aliases. \\n\\n- Specifies project references and framework references for the target framework.\\n\\n- Defines import and asset target fallback behavior, warnings, and the runtime identifier graph path used.\\n\\n- Is used by the NuGet restore process to determine which packages need to be restored for the project based on the packages.config/PackageReference configuration and dependencies. \\n\\n- Provides a way to cache and restore the NuGet restore process without having to re-evaluate project assets and dependencies each time.\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the configuration needed to restore NuGet packages for a .NET project in an efficient cached manner on subsequent builds/restores.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Interfaces/Persistence/ITagRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for a tag repository in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the Diary.Application.Common.Interfaces.Persistence namespace, indicating it is an interface for a persistence layer.\\n\\n- It inherits from ITagRepository, indicating it will provide data access functions for Tag domain objects.\\n\\n- The only method defined is Add(Tags tags). This allows adding a new Tags object to the data store via the repository.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a contract/interface for accessing tag data\\n- The repository will handle data access functions for Tag domain objects \\n- Currently it only defines an Add method to insert a new Tags object\\n\\nOther common repository functions it may include are:\\n\\n- Get \\n- GetById\\n- Update\\n- Delete\\n- etc\\n\\nBut at a minimum it exposes an interface for inserting tag data via the persistence layer. Any class implementing this interface can then handle the actual data access/storage.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/obj/project.packagespec.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a project.packagespec.json file that is used by the .NET package restore process.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Stores metadata about the project like the path, framework targets etc. This is used to identify the project during restore.\\n\\n- Defines package sources that will be used to restore packages from, like NuGet.org.\\n\\n- Defines project dependencies and references, including other projects in the solution.\\n\\n- Specifies the target framework(s) the project supports and any framework-specific configuration.\\n\\n- Defines package references and versions that should be restored for the project. \\n\\n- Stores information needed for restoring dependencies like transitive packages.\\n\\n- Allows configuring restore behavior like warning properties.\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the information needed by the NuGet/dotnet restore process to correctly restore the project\\u0027s package dependencies from the configured sources. This ensures all packages required by the project are available after restore.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Profile/Common/ProfileResult.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a ProfileResult record type that is used to return profile data from the Profile application service in Diary.Application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- ProfileResult is a record type, which means it is a lightweight data class that is immutable and has public read-only properties.\\n\\n- It has properties for the login, email, first name, and last name of a user profile. \\n\\n- This is likely used as the return type from methods in the Profile application service to retrieve and return user profile data in a clean, typed way.\\n\\n- By using a record type, it avoids having to define get-only properties or a constructor - the properties are directly accessible.\\n\\n- This separates the data transfer object (ProfileResult) from the application service logic, keeping things cleanly separated.\\n\\n- ProfileResult serves to encapsulate and transfer profile data between the application and presentation layers in a strongly typed way.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a simple DTO/data transfer object for returning profile data from services in a clean, immutable way without unnecessary boilerplate code.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/appsettings.json\&quot;:\&quot;This appsettings.json file is used to configure settings for an ASP.NET Core API application.\\n\\nKey things it is doing:\\n\\n- Configuring logging levels - it sets the default log level to Information and Microsoft.AspNetCore logs to Warning level. This controls the verbosity of logging output.\\n\\n- Allowing all hosts - the \\\&quot;AllowedHosts\\\&quot; setting with \\\&quot;*\\\&quot; allows requests from any origin. This is common for development but should be restricted in production. \\n\\n- Configuring JWT authentication settings - It sets the secret key used to sign JWT tokens, their expiry time in minutes, and the issuer and audience claims included in the tokens. These are used to implement JWT authentication in the API.\\n\\n- The JWTSettings section allows configuring aspects related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that are likely used for authentication - things like the secret, expiration, and standard claims like issuer and audience.\\n\\nSo in summary, it is setting up logging, CORS/host restrictions, and JWT authentication settings that the API will use via configuration rather than hardcoded values. This makes the settings configurable without recompiling code.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Authentication/JwtTokenGenerator.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file implements the IJwtTokenGenerator interface and contains the logic for generating JWT tokens.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- GenerateToken(): Takes a Users object and generates a JWT token for that user. It:\\n\\n  - Creates the signing credentials using the secret from the JwtSettings\\n\\n  - Creates the claims to put in the token like sub, name, jti\\n\\n  - Creates a new JwtSecurityToken using the claims, signing credentials, issuer, audience, expiration\\n\\n  - Returns the token as a string by writing the JwtSecurityToken\\n\\n- It uses the IDateTimeProvider to get the current UTC time for setting the expiration\\n\\n- It reads the JWT settings like secret, issuer, audience, expiration minutes from the JwtSettings options\\n\\nSo in summary, it generates signed JWT tokens for users by creating the claims, token, and signing it according to the JWT settings.

The API will read settings from this file specifically when run in the development environment.\\n\\n- Externalizes configuration details outside of code for easier management. Settings can be changed without redeploying the API.\\n\\n- Provides a single source of configuration truth for the development environment.\\n\\nSo in summary, it handles logging and authentication configuration that varies by environment in a code-free manner for the development environment.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Api.AssemblyInfo.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file (Diary.Api.AssemblyInfo.cs) contains assembly level attributes for the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Identifies the user secrets ID used by the project for storing secrets like API keys, passwords etc. This is done via the UserSecretsIdAttribute.\\n\\n- Provides metadata about the assembly like company name, product name, version etc. This is done via attributes like AssemblyCompanyAttribute, AssemblyProductAttribute etc. \\n\\n- Specifies the file version and informational version of the assembly.

In this case, it renames the \\\&quot;nikname\\\&quot; column to \\\&quot;login\\\&quot; in the \\\&quot;user\\\&quot; table.\\n\\n- Down - Contains the logic to roll back the migration if needed. Here it renames the \\\&quot;login\\\&quot; column back to \\\&quot;nikname\\\&quot;. \\n\\n- This migration allows renaming a column in the database table without losing any data. The Up method runs the rename, and Down undoes it if needed.\\n\\n- Migration files allow evolving the database schema over time by applying incremental changes via migrations, instead of having to rebuild the database from scratch.\\n\\n- Entity Framework Core uses these migrations to synchronize the database schema with the code model and apply pending changes to the database on application startup.\\n\\nSo in summary, this migration file updates the database table structure by renaming a column, providing both the forward and backward logic for the change.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231120235445_upddate.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a database migration for the Diary.Infrastructure project.\\n\\nDatabase migrations are used to evolve a database schema over time as the application code changes. Each migration file represents a single change to the database.\\n\\nThe key things this migration file does:\\n\\n- Defines a class called upddate that inherits from Migration\\n- Contains an Up method that will be executed to apply the migration\\n- Alters the CreateDate column on the Note table to change its data type from timestamp with time zone to timestamp without time zone and sets a default value of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n- Contains a Down method that reverses the changes made in Up, to allow rolling back the migration if needed\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a database migration \\n- Alters the data type of an existing column\\n- Sets a default value for the column\\n- Provides Up and Down methods to apply/revert the changes\\n\\nThis allows evolving the database schema over time in a version controlled manner as the application code changes.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025123228_update tag.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a database migration for the Entity Framework Core database context used in the Diary.Infrastructure project.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Updates the Tag table by altering the Name column type from text to varchar(50)\\n\\n- Up() method contains the logic to alter the column type on applying the migration\\n\\n- Down() method contains the reverse logic to revert the column type change if rolling back the migration \\n\\n- Inherits from Migration class which provides the base functionality for database migrations\\n\\n- Is used by Entity Framework Core to apply schema changes to the database when the project is built/updated\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a database schema migration \\n- Alters the data type of an existing column\\n- Provides Up() and Down() methods to apply/revert the change\\n- Allows Entity Framework Core to manage the database schema\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Interfaces/Authentication/IPasswordHasher.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for password hashing functionality in the Diary application.\\n\\nThe IPasswordHasher interface defines the contract for classes that can hash and verify passwords. Classes that implement this interface will be able to:\\n\\n- GeneratePassword(string password) - Takes a plain text password and hashes it using a secure hashing algorithm. This is used when a user creates or changes their password.\\n\\n- VerifyPassword(string password, string passwordHash) - Takes a plain text password and an existing hashed password, hashes the plain text and compares the hashes to verify if the password matches. This is used when a user attempts to log in. \\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- GeneratePassword() - Hashes a plain text password for storage \\n- VerifyPassword() - Verifies a plain text password matches an existing hashed password\\n\\nThe purpose of this interface is to abstract away the password hashing logic, so different hashing algorithms/libraries can be used without changing code that relies on password verification/generation. Classes that implement this interface can securely hash and verify passwords.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025175803_upd cascade delete.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a migration file in Entity Framework Core that updates the database schema.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Updates foreign key constraints on some tables to use cascade deletes instead of no action. Specifically:\\n  - Calendar -\\u003e User \\n  - TagNote -\\u003e Note\\n  - TagNote -\\u003e Tag\\n\\n- The Up method:\\n  - Drops the existing foreign key constraints\\n  - Adds new foreign key constraints with ON DELETE CASCADE action\\n\\n- The Down method: \\n  - Drops the foreign key constraints added in Up\\n  - Re-adds the original foreign key constraints without cascade deletes\\n\\nSo in summary, it modifies the database schema to enable cascade deletes on some relationships when records are deleted, to maintain referential integrity. \\n\\nThe Up and Down methods allow applying and reversing the schema change when running EF migrations to update the database.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Commands/Create/CreateNoteCommand.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a command for creating a new note in the diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a CreateNoteCommand class that inherits from IRequest\\u003cNotes\\u003e. IRequest indicates it is a MediatR command that will return a Notes object.\\n\\n- The command takes in the UserId and a CreateNote object. This contains the data needed to create the note (title, content etc). \\n\\n- It uses MediatR for handling commands in an asynchronous way. MediatR is a mediator library that handles passing commands/queries to their handlers.\\n\\n- When handled, this command will create a new note entity using the data passed in and return a Notes object containing the newly created note.\\n\\n- The main function is to define the data contract for creating a new note via a command. This separates the command from the actual note creation logic which would be handled in a separate class.\\n\\n- Keywords:\\n  - MediatR - For asynchronous command handling\\n  - IRequest - Indicates it is a command that returns a result\\n  - CreateNoteCommand - The name of the command class\\n  - UserId, Note - The data needed to create the note\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the data and interface for a command to create a new note in the application.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/bin/Debug/net7.0/appsettings.Development.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an appsettings configuration file used by the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Configures logging levels - it sets the default log level to Information and Microsoft.AspNetCore logs to Warning level. This controls the verbosity of logging output.\\n\\n- Configures JWT (JSON Web Token) settings used for authentication/authorization:\\n\\n  - Secret - The secret key used to sign JWTs issued by the API\\n\\n  - ExpiryMinutes - How long JWTs remain valid before expiring\\n\\n  - Issuer - The issuer claim value included in all JWTs\\n\\n  - Audience - The intended audience of the JWTs\\n\\n- This is a development configuration file (appsettings.Development.json) which would be used when running the API locally in development/debug mode. There may be other environment-specific configuration files like appsettings.Production.json.\\n\\n- Provides configuration values that can be injected into the API via the configuration system, rather than having hardcoded values. This makes the configuration customizable and environment-aware.\\n\\nSo in summary, it centrally defines logging and JWT auth settings that the Diary.Api project will use at runtime when in the development environment.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/Tag/Tags.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a Tags class that represents tags in the domain model for a diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a Tags class that will represent tag entities.\\n\\n- Tags have an Id (unique identifier), Name property. \\n\\n- It has a Notes navigation property that represents the collection of Notes associated with this tag. This establishes the many-to-many relationship between Tags and Notes.\\n\\n- The Notes property is of type ICollection\\u003cNotes\\u003e which allows adding/removing notes from the collection.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Stores basic tag properties like Id and Name\\n\\n- Allows associating multiple notes to a tag via the Notes navigation property \\n\\n- Defines the entity that represents tags in the domain model and its relationships to notes\\n\\n- Provides a class for representing tag data that can be used throughout the application\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the Tag entity for the domain model including its properties and relationships to notes, to model tags and their associations with notes in the diary application.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025175803_upd cascade delete.Designer.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a migration file for Entity Framework Core. It is used to update the database schema.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- BuildTargetModel - This method builds the model that represents the target schema for the database. It configures the entities and relationships between them.\\n\\n- HasAnnotation - Adds annotations to the model builder to identify the database context type, migration name, etc. \\n\\n- Entity configuration - Configures the properties and relationships for each entity (tables in the database). Things like primary keys, foreign keys, data types, indexes, etc.\\n\\n- Model relationships - Defines the relationships between entities like one-to-many, many-to-many using Fluent API. Also specifies cascade deletes.\\n\\n- ToTable - Maps the entity to a database table. \\n\\n- HasKey - Specifies the primary key property.\\n\\n- HasIndex - Creates indexes on properties. \\n\\n- HasForeignKey - Configures foreign key properties and relationships. \\n\\n- WithMany/WithOne - Configures the navigation properties for relationships.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the target database schema model that Entity Framework will apply when updating the database during a migration.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/obj/project.assets.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a project.assets.json file that contains metadata about a .NET project and its package references.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Stores information about the target frameworks the project supports (e.g. net7.0)\\n- Contains restore information like the project path, packages path, NuGet config files, package sources etc. Used for restoring package references.\\n- Stores information about package and project dependencies per target framework.\\n- Specifies fallback folders that will be searched for packages in addition to the main packages path.\\n- Defines framework-specific settings like imports, asset target fallback, warnings etc. \\n- Provides the runtime identifier graph path which maps runtime identifiers to target frameworks.\\n\\nIn summary, it contains all the metadata needed by the .NET tools to understand the project and its dependencies, and to restore and build the project correctly across different target frameworks. It essentially captures the package and project graph for a given .NET project.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Authentication/Queries/Login/LoginQuery.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a MediatR query for user login in a CQRS/Mediator pattern application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- LoginQuery is a record (immutable class) that defines the request data - the login and password. \\n\\n- It implements IRequest\\u003cT\\u003e where T is the AuthenticationResult response type. This defines it as a MediatR request.\\n\\n- The query will be handled by a LoginQueryHandler that implements IRequestHandler\\u003cLoginQuery, AuthenticationResult\\u003e. \\n\\n- The handler will perform the login logic - validate credentials, generate auth token etc.\\n\\n- AuthenticationResult is a common response type defined elsewhere to encapsulate the auth result.\\n\\n- Using MediatR/CQRS pattern, this separates the query (request) from the handling logic, keeping the code decoupled and testable.\\n\\n- Clients can make this request by creating a LoginQuery instance and passing it to the Mediator.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the login query request data and shapes the request-response, without containing any handling logic. The actual work is delegated to a separate handler class.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Authentication/Queries/Login/LoginQueryHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains the handler for the LoginQuery MediatR query.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Handle - The main handler method that is called when the LoginQuery is executed. It handles the login workflow:\\n\\n  1. Retrieves the user from the repository by login \\n  2. Validates the password hash matches the provided password\\n  3. Generates a JWT token\\n  4. Returns an AuthenticationResult with the user and token\\n\\n- It depends on:\\n\\n  - IJwtTokenGenerator to generate the JWT token\\n  - IPasswordHasher to validate the password \\n  - IUserRepository to retrieve the user\\n\\nSo in summary, it handles the login business logic - validating the credentials and generating the authentication token if valid. The dependencies allow it to retrieve the user, validate the password, and generate the token.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/bin/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Contracts.deps.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a dependencies file (.deps.json) that contains metadata about the dependencies of the Diary.Contracts project.\\n\\nSome key things it does/contains:\\n\\n- Defines the runtime target (.NET Core 7.0) that the project targets.\\n\\n- Lists the compilation options used to build the project. \\n\\n- Defines the targets - in this case just .NET Core 7.0.\\n\\n- Lists the assemblies/libraries that are part of the project - in this case just the Diary.Contracts assembly. \\n\\n- Provides metadata about each library like the version, type (project vs package), whether it can be serviced, and a SHA512 hash.\\n\\n- Allows restoring the project and its dependencies by providing information about what libraries the project depends on and what runtime it targets.\\n\\n- Is used by tools like dotnet to resolve, restore and install dependencies when building or running the project.\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the metadata needed to describe the dependencies and targets of the project to enable dependency restoration and resolution.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/obj/Debug/net7.0/.NETCoreApp,Version\\u003dv7.0.AssemblyAttributes.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an assembly attributes file generated by the .NET compiler.\\n\\nIt contains metadata attributes that are applied to the assembly. The main purpose of this file is to specify the target framework for the assembly.\\n\\nKey functions/attributes:\\n\\n- TargetFrameworkAttribute - Specifies that the target framework for the assembly is .NET Core 7.0. This informs other code/tools which version of .NET the assembly is compiled for.\\n\\n- FrameworkDisplayName - Provides a human-readable name for the target framework, in this case \\\&quot;.NET 7.0\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- Assembly attributes in general provide metadata about the assembly that can be read at runtime via reflection. This includes things like assembly name, version, copyright etc. \\n\\n- The attributes in this file don\\u0027t contain any code - they just annotate the assembly with metadata. This file is auto-generated by the compiler.\\n\\n- Specifying the target framework is important for things like assembly binding/loading, determining what framework-specific APIs can be used, and ensuring compatibility with the correct .NET version.\\n\\nSo in summary, it identifies the target framework metadata for reflection and ensures the assembly is only used in the intended framework version.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Commands/Create/CreateNoteCommandHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a command handler for creating a new note.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It implements the IRequestHandler interface for the CreateNoteCommand message type. This tells MediatR that this class handles the CreateNoteCommand message.\\n\\n- The constructor injects the INoteRepository and IUnitOfWork interfaces. These will be used to persist the new note to the database.\\n\\n- The Handle method takes the CreateNoteCommand message and request payload as parameters. \\n\\n- It creates a new Notes domain entity and populates it from the command data.\\n\\n- It adds the new note entity to the note repository. \\n\\n- It saves any pending changes to the database by calling SaveChangesAsync on the unit of work. \\n\\n- It returns the created note entity.\\n\\nSo in summary, this command handler is responsible for:\\n\\n1. Mapping the command data to a domain entity\\n2. Persisting the entity to the database \\n3. Returning the created entity\\n\\nIt uses the repository and unit of work patterns to abstract data access.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Queries/GetAllByUserId/GetAllNotesByUserIdQuery.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a MediatR query to get all notes by a user ID.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a record called GetAllNotesByUserIdQuery that takes a Guid UserId as a parameter. This will be the query payload.\\n\\n- It implements the IRequest interface, specifying the response type will be ICollection\\u003cNotes\\u003e?. This means it will return a collection of Note domain objects, or null. \\n\\n- Using MediatR, this defines a query that can be executed to retrieve notes for a given user. The query payload is just the UserId.\\n\\n- When executed, this query will trigger the corresponding handler class to retrieve the notes from the data store and return them.\\n\\n- The ? after ICollection\\u003cNotes\\u003e means the collection returned could be null if no notes are found for that user.\\n\\nSo in summary, its key functions are:\\n\\n1. Define the query payload \\n2. Specify the response type\\n3. Trigger the handler to retrieve and return notes when executed\\n\\nThis allows querying for notes in a clean, decoupled way using the MediatR library for CQRS/mediation.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Authentication/JwtSettings.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This JwtSettings class is used to configure the JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication settings in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a constant SectionName that will be used to retrieve these settings from the appsettings.json configuration file.\\n\\n- It has properties for the JWT secret, expiration time in minutes, issuer, and audience. These are the main claims needed to generate and validate JWTs.\\n\\n- The properties are initialized using the null-forgiving operator (!) to ensure they are not null.\\n\\n- This class centralizes all the JWT configuration in one place that can be easily accessed.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Stores the JWT secret, expiration, issuer and audience claims needed to generate and validate JWTs.\\n\\n- Allows retrieving the JWT settings from configuration using the SectionName constant. \\n\\n- Centralizes all JWT configuration in one class for easy access throughout the authentication code.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a class to encapsulate and configure the JWT authentication settings for the Diary app in a centralized and accessible way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025123346_userinfo upd.Designer.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a migration file for Entity Framework Core.

It defines the schema.\\n\\n- HasAnnotation - Adds annotations to the migration, like the database context type and migration name. \\n\\n- Entity configurations - Defines the properties and relationships of each entity/table. Things like primary keys, data types, indexes, foreign keys etc. \\n\\n- ModelBuilder extensions - Adds things like default primary key values.\\n\\n- Navigations - Defines the navigation properties between entities to represent relationships.\\n\\nThe purpose of this file is to programmatically represent the database schema using Entity Framework migrations. When run, it will apply any changes defined in the BuildTargetModel method to the database schema. This allows schema changes to be version controlled and applied/reverted as needed when deploying code changes.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/obj/Debug/net7.0/staticwebassets.build.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a static web assets build manifest generated by the .NET static web assets build process.\\n\\nKey things it does/contains:\\n\\n- Version - The version of the static web assets build format.

Things like the assembly name, version, company, etc. This file is auto-generated by the compiler and contains standard attributes that provide assembly-level metadata.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Services/DateTimeProvider.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file implements the IDateTimeProvider interface from the Application layer to provide date/time services to the Infrastructure layer.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is in the Infrastructure layer, which implements interfaces defined in the Application layer.\\n\\n- It implements the IDateTimeProvider interface. This interface is defined in the Application layer to abstract date/time functionality.\\n\\n- It has a single method called UtcNow that returns the current UTC date/time via DateTime.UtcNow. \\n\\n- This allows any code in the Infrastructure layer that needs the current UTC date/time to simply depend on IDateTimeProvider instead of directly using DateTime.UtcNow.\\n\\n- It follows the Dependency Inversion principle - the Application layer defines the abstraction (IDateTimeProvider) and the Infrastructure layer implements it (DateTimeProvider class).\\n\\n- Provides a way to mock/stub date/time in unit tests by injecting a test double for IDateTimeProvider instead of using the real DateTimeProvider class.\\n\\nSo in summary, it implements a date/time provider interface to abstract date/time functionality and provide the current UTC datetime to other infrastructure classes in a decoupled way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Note/CreateNote.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a record type for creating notes in the diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- Namespace: Diary.Application.Common.Note - Indicates this is a common note entity for the diary application\\n\\n- CreateNote is a record type - Records are immutable data structures in C#\\n\\n- It has two properties:\\n  - Content - The text content of the note\\n  - Name - The name/title of the note\\n\\n- This record type is used to represent the data needed to create a new note. It encapsulates the minimum required properties (content and name) to create a valid note entity.\\n\\n- Some key functions/purposes:\\n  - Acts as a data transfer object (DTO) - Used to pass note creation data between layers\\n  - Enforces a consistent shape for new note data\\n  - Immutable - Note creation data cannot be modified once instantiated\\n  - Self-documenting - Clearly shows what is needed to create a note\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a simple immutable DTO for representing the data needed to create a new note entity in the diary application. This facilitates passing validated note data between layers.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/obj/Diary.Infrastructure.csproj.nuget.dgspec.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a .nuget.dgspec.json file, which contains dependency and restoration information for a .NET project.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Stores metadata about each project in the solution, including path, target frameworks, dependencies, etc. \\n\\n- Defines the restore process for each project - where packages will be restored from, fallback folders, config files to use, etc.\\n\\n- Defines the dependencies for each target framework in each project.

This allows other parts of the application to easily access these configured services via dependency injection.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/User/Users.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines the Users entity/model in the Diary.Domain.User namespace.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It represents a user in the system who can create/view notes.\\n\\n- It has properties for the user\\u0027s ID, login, hashed password, register date.\\n\\n- It has a collection of Notes that belong to the user. This allows querying/retrieving all notes for a user. \\n\\n- It has a reference to an optional UsersInfo object. This is a separate entity that stores additional user profile/info details.\\n\\n- The Notes and UserInfo properties use virtual to enable lazy loading in an ORM like Entity Framework.\\n\\n- It defines the core user data needed to represent and work with users in the system, and link them to related note and profile data.\\n\\nIn summary, the key functions of this file/class are:\\n\\n- Define the user entity/model \\n- Store user identifying/authentication fields\\n- Link a user to their notes and additional profile info\\n- Enable relationships in an ORM for querying related data\\n\\nSo in essence it models the user data and relationships needed for the diary application functionality.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Interfaces/Persistence/IUserRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for a user repository in the persistence layer.\\n\\nThe IUserRepository interface:\\n\\n- Defines functions for interacting with Users entities in a data store.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Add(Users users) - Adds a new user to the data store\\n- GetByLogin(string login) - Gets a user by their login \\n- GetByUserId(Guid userId) - Gets a user by their user ID\\n- IsLoginExist(string login) - Checks if a login already exists in the data store\\n\\nThe purpose of this interface is to abstract the data access logic for users away from the application layer. Any class that implements this interface can then be used to retrieve, add, and query user data without the application layer needing to know the specific data store implementation.\\n\\nThis allows the persistence layer to be decoupled and easily swapped out or changed without affecting the application code. The application only interacts with the interface, not the concrete implementation.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231024130135_Initial.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a class called Initial that inherits from Migration. It is used to define the initial database schema/structure for an Entity Framework Core project.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Up method:\\n  - Defines the CreateTable operations to create the database tables\\n  - Defines primary keys and foreign key constraints\\n- Down method: \\n  - Defines the reverse operations to drop the tables, in case we want to rollback the migration\\n\\nIn summary, this migration file:\\n\\n- Defines the initial database schema on application startup \\n- Creates all the necessary tables\\n- Establishes relationships between tables through primary/foreign keys\\n- Provides a way to rollback the changes if needed\\n\\nSo in one file it handles both creating and optionally dropping the database structure for the initial state of the data model.

This includes entity configurations like properties, keys, indexes, relationships etc.\\n\\n- Inherits from the Migration class to mark it as a migration. \\n\\n- Has a migration identifier (\\\&quot;20231024211636_user update (login unique)\\\&quot;) to uniquely identify this migration.\\n\\n- Builds the target model by configuring entities like Users, UserInfo, Calendars, Notes etc. \\n\\n- Adds indexes like making the Login property unique on Users.\\n\\n- Defines relationships between entities like one-to-many between User and UserInfo.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- BuildTargetModel - Defines the target database schema after applying this migration.\\n- HasAnnotation - Adds metadata annotations like database provider.\\n- Entity configuration - Configures entities like properties, keys etc. \\n- Index configuration - Adds indexes like unique constraints.\\n- Relationship configuration - Defines relationships between entities.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the schema changes to apply via Entity Framework migrations to update the database as per the domain model changes.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/Controllers/AuthenticationController.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an AuthenticationController for the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nIt handles authentication requests for registering and logging in users.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Register - Handles POST requests to /auth/register. Sends a RegisterCommand to the mediator to register a new user. Returns an AuthenticationResponse.\\n\\n- Login - Handles POST requests to /auth/login. Sends a LoginQuery to the mediator to authenticate a user. Returns an AuthenticationResponse. \\n\\n- It uses MediatR to send commands/queries to the application layer for authentication logic.\\n\\n- The requests/responses use DTOs defined in Diary.Contracts.Authentication to transfer data between layers.\\n\\n- It returns AuthenticationResponse objects containing the authenticated user details and JWT token.\\n\\n- It follows a clean architecture approach by separating the API controller from application/domain logic using MediatR and DTOs.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides the API endpoints for user registration and authentication, while delegating the actual logic to the application layer via MediatR.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/obj/Debug/net7.0/.NETCoreApp,Version\\u003dv7.0.AssemblyAttributes.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an assembly attributes file generated by the .NET compiler.\\n\\nIt contains metadata attributes that are applied to the assembly. The main purpose of this file is to specify the target framework for the assembly.\\n\\nKey functions/attributes:\\n\\n- TargetFrameworkAttribute - Specifies that the target framework for the assembly is .NET Core 7.0. This informs other code/tools which version of .NET the assembly is compiled for.\\n\\n- FrameworkDisplayName - Provides a human-readable name for the target framework, in this case \\\&quot;.NET 7.0\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- Assembly attributes in general provide metadata about the assembly that can be read at runtime via reflection. This includes things like assembly name, version, copyright etc. \\n\\n- The attributes in this file don\\u0027t contain any code - they just annotate the assembly with metadata. This file is auto-generated by the compiler and isn\\u0027t intended to be modified directly.\\n\\nSo in summary, it specifies the target framework for reflection and allows other code to identify which .NET version the assembly was compiled for.

The main purpose is to encapsulate data access and provide a clean interface to retrieve/persist UserInfo domain objects while abstracting away the underlying data access implementation.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/obj/project.assets.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a project.assets.json file that is generated by the .NET SDK and contains information about the dependencies and assets for a .NET project.\\n\\nSome key functions/information it contains:\\n\\n- Defines the project targets (frameworks) like .NET 7.0\\n- Lists all the package references and dependencies for the project\\n- Contains metadata about each package like version, files included, dependencies etc. \\n- Defines the project structure - projects, packages etc.\\n- Stores information about the last restore operation - packages path, sources etc.\\n- Defines framework references and imports for the target frameworks\\n- Contains asset targeting information\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n- It stores all the dependency and asset information for a .NET project in one place after a restore.\\n- It is used by tools like MSBuild to understand the project structure and dependencies.\\n- On build/publish it ensures correct dependencies and assets are included for the target frameworks. \\n- It avoids needing to contact remote sources for dependency information on subsequent builds.\\n\\nSo in essence it caches all the dependency and asset metadata needed for building the project after a restore operation. This improves build performance by having this information locally.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Domain.GlobalUsings.g.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an auto-generated file that defines global usings for the Diary.Domain project in .NET.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It has the \\u003cauto-generated/\\u003e tag which indicates it is auto-generated and not meant to be manually edited.\\n\\n- It defines a set of \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directives for commonly used namespaces in the System namespace like System, System.Collections.Generic, etc. \\n\\n- The \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directive tells the compiler to make types in those namespaces available without needing to qualify them with the namespace. So types like List, String, Task etc. can be used without namespace qualification.\\n\\n- This allows for cleaner code in the project by avoiding needing to repeatedly qualify common types with their namespaces.\\n\\n- The namespaces included cover common core functionality like collections, IO, threading etc. that are likely to be used throughout the project.\\n\\n- Additional namespaces can be added here if needed by the project to further reduce namespace qualifications.\\n\\n- It is generated at build/compile time based on the project\\u0027s configuration to ensure the global usings are always in sync.\\n\\nSo in summary, this file centrally defines global usings to clean up code by avoiding namespace qualifications for commonly used types throughout the project. The compiler uses it to understand the intended namespaces for unqualified types.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/User/Queries/IsLoginExist/IsLoginExistQueryHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a query handler class for the IsLoginExist query in the Diary.Application User queries project.\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- IsLoginExistQueryHandler implements the IRequestHandler interface for the IsLoginExistQuery message type. This allows it to handle queries of that type.\\n\\n- It takes an IUserRepository in the constructor for data access. \\n\\n- The Handle method gets called when an IsLoginExistQuery is received. It calls the IsLoginExist method on the user repository, passing the login from the query, to check if that login already exists. \\n\\n- IsLoginExist on the repository returns a bool indicating if the login exists or not. \\n\\n- This returns the result to the caller to indicate if the login passed in the query is already in use.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructor - Initializes the user repository dependency\\n- Handle - Main handler method that calls the repository and returns the result\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides the query handling logic to check if a login already exists by delegating to the user repository data access layer.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Authentication/Commands/Register/RegisterCommand.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a command for registering a new user in the application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a RegisterCommand class that inherits from IRequest\\u003cAuthenticationResult\\u003e. This means it is a MediatR command that will return an AuthenticationResult object.\\n\\n- The RegisterCommand class has properties for the login, password, email, first name and last name of the user being registered. \\n\\n- When executed via MediatR, this command will trigger the registration process - it likely calls a user registration service which will hash the password, save the user details to the database, and return an AuthenticationResult with things like an auth token.\\n\\n- The AuthenticationResult return type indicates this command is for authentication/authorization purposes - registering a user so they can then authenticate.\\n\\n- It is in the Authentication.Commands.Register namespace, showing it is a command related to the registration process of the authentication system.\\n\\nSo in summary, this defines a command object that can be used to trigger the user registration process via MediatR, providing the required user details, and returning an authentication result like a token.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This DependencyInjection.cs file configures the dependency injection for the infrastructure layer in the ASP.NET Core application.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- AddInfrastructure() - Adds authentication and persistence services to the DI container.\\n\\n- AddPersistence() - Registers the DbContext and repositories for data access.\\n\\n- AddAuth() - Configures JWT authentication:\\n\\n  - Binds JWT settings from configuration\\n  - Registers JWT token generator and password hasher services\\n  - Adds JWT bearer authentication middleware\\n\\n- It registers the necessary services and repositories for authentication, data access and unit of work pattern. \\n\\n- Configures the JWT bearer authentication middleware, including token validation parameters and a custom OnMessageReceived handler to extract the token from query string for requests to the /note path.\\n\\nSo in summary, it wires up all the infrastructure services and dependencies needed by the application layers.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/Controllers/ApiController.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an ApiController class that serves as a base controller for API controllers in the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It inherits from ControllerBase, which is the base class for ASP.NET Core MVC controllers. This allows it to act as a controller.\\n\\n- It has the [ApiController] attribute applied. This tells ASP.NET Core that this is an API controller and to apply certain conventions/behaviors for API controllers.\\n\\n- It doesn\\u0027t define any actions/methods itself. The intention is for other controllers to inherit from this base ApiController class and define their own action methods.\\n\\n- By inheriting other controllers from this base class, it establishes common behaviors/conventions for all API controllers. For example, any attributes applied to this class would also apply to derived classes.\\n\\n- It provides a common base that controllers can share code/logic from if needed. For example, you could define common helper methods or properties on this class.\\n\\nSo in summary, its key purpose is to act as a base class that establishes common patterns/behaviors for all API controllers in this project by inheriting from it. Individual controllers would then define their specific endpoint logic by inheriting from this base class.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Api.GlobalUsings.g.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an auto-generated file that defines global usings for namespaces in the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It is generated automatically by the .NET tooling based on the namespaces used in the project.\\n\\n- The \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directives make namespaces available throughout the project without needing to explicitly import them in each file. \\n\\n- It includes common ASP.NET Core namespaces like Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting, etc. that are likely needed project-wide.\\n\\n- It also includes common System namespaces like System, System.Collections.Generic, System.Linq, etc. \\n\\n- Adding or removing namespaces from actual code files will cause this file to be regenerated with updates global usings.\\n\\nSo in summary, the key functions of this file are:\\n\\n- Define global namespaces that are available everywhere in the project\\n- Reduce boilerplate code by not needing explicit imports in each file\\n- Get auto-updated when namespace usage changes elsewhere in the codebase\\n\\nIt helps clean up code by centralizing commonly used namespace imports in one place.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Note/UpdateNote.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a record type for updating a note in the diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the Diary.Application.Common.Note namespace. This indicates it is part of the common/shared code for working with notes.\\n\\n- UpdateNote is defined as a record type. Records in C# are immutable data structures, similar to classes but with value semantics. \\n\\n- No properties are defined on the UpdateNote record. This implies it is just a marker/envelope for the update note operation, and the actual note properties/values would be passed separately, likely as parameters to methods that accept an UpdateNote.\\n\\n- Some key functions this would enable:\\n\\n  - Updating an existing note by passing an UpdateNote record and new note values to a method\\n\\n  - Validating an UpdateNote record before allowing the update to occur\\n\\n  - Logging/auditing note updates by capturing the UpdateNote that triggered them\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a type for representing a note update operation, without specifying the actual note property values. This allows methods/services to accept update requests in a standardized way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Commands/Update/UpdateNoteCommand.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a command for updating a note in the diary application using MediatR.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- UpdateNoteCommand is a record (immutable class) that defines the data needed for the command - the note ID, name, and content. \\n\\n- It implements IRequest\\u003cNotes\\u003e to indicate it is a request that will return a Notes object.\\n\\n- This is a command class defined to be handled by MediatR. Commands in MediatR trigger side effects like database updates.\\n\\n- When an instance of UpdateNoteCommand is sent to the Mediator, it will be handled by a command handler that will perform the database/repository update logic.\\n\\n- The handler will update the note with the given ID with the new name and content values passed in. \\n\\n- It will then return the updated Notes entity/aggregate from the database context.\\n\\nSo in summary, its key functions are:\\n\\n1. Define the data payload for the update note command\\n2. Indicate it is a request handled by MediatR \\n3. Trigger the note update logic in a command handler\\n4. Return the updated note entity\\n\\nIt provides a clean way to encapsulate the note update operation using CQRS/MediatR patterns.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Persistence/Repositories/TagRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a TagRepository class that is used to interact with the database for Tag entities.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is in the Persistence/Repositories namespace, indicating it is a data access repository class.\\n\\n- It has a constructor that accepts a DiaryDbContext, which is the DbContext used to connect to the database. This context is stored in a private field.\\n\\n- No other methods are defined, but this is intended to be the starting point for common CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods for Tag entities:\\n\\n  - GetTag() \\n  - GetTags()\\n  - AddTag()\\n  - UpdateTag()\\n  - DeleteTag()\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a repository class for Tag entities\\n- It establishes a connection to the database context \\n- It provides a starting point to add CRUD methods for working with Tag data in the database\\n\\nThe purpose is to encapsulate data access logic and provide a clean interface to work with Tag entities via common repository patterns and patterns.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Authentication/PasswordHasher.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file implements the IPasswordHasher interface from the Diary.Application.Common.Interfaces.Authentication namespace.\\n\\nIt provides password hashing functionality using the BCrypt algorithm.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- GeneratePassword(string password) - Hashes the given password using BCrypt and returns the hashed password string.\\n\\n- VerifyPassword(string password, string passwordHash) - Verifies that the given password matches the hashed password using BCrypt and returns a boolean.\\n\\nThe purpose of this class is to securely hash passwords when storing them in the database, and verify passwords during login by comparing the hashed password to a hashed version of the entered password without revealing the original password. This helps protect user passwords if the database is ever compromised.\\n\\nBy implementing the IPasswordHasher interface, it provides a reusable password hashing service that can be injected where needed, keeping password logic centralized in one place.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025122721_add tags and relationships.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a migration for the Diary.Infrastructure database context in an Entity Framework Core project.\\n\\nMigrations in EF Core are used to modify the database schema over time as the domain model changes. This particular migration is adding tags and relationships between tags and notes.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Renames tables and columns to match new naming conventions \\n- Adds primary keys to tables\\n- Creates new Tag and TagNote tables\\n- Defines relationships between tables via foreign keys\\n- Handles renaming/recreating indexes\\n\\nThe Up() method handles applying the migration - adding new tables/columns, renaming things, defining relationships. \\n\\nThe Down() method undoes the changes, reversing what was done in Up(). This allows rolling back the migration if needed.\\n\\nSo in summary, this migration file:\\n\\n- Modifies the database schema to support tags and tag-note relationships\\n- Handles renaming/renaming columns, tables, indexes to match changes\\n- Defines primary keys and foreign key relationships between tables\\n\\nIt allows evolving the database structure over time in a managed way using EF Core migrations.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/bin/Debug/net7.0/appsettings.json\&quot;:\&quot;This appsettings.json file contains configuration settings for the Diary.Api project in .NET.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Configures logging levels - sets the default log level to Information and Microsoft.AspNetCore logs to Warning level. This controls the verbosity of logging output.\\n\\n- Sets AllowedHosts to *, which allows requests from any host for development purposes. This relaxes security. \\n\\n- Contains JWT (JSON Web Token) settings for authentication:\\n\\n  - Secret - The secret key used to sign JWTs \\n  - ExpiryMinutes - How long JWTs remain valid before expiring\\n  - Issuer - Identifies the issuer of the JWT\\n  - Audience - Identifies the intended recipients of the JWT\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n- Configures logging\\n- Sets allowed hosts for development \\n- Defines JWT authentication settings like secret, expiry and claims\\n\\nThis allows the API project to be configured via code for things like logging, security and authentication without having to modify code directly. The settings can then be changed without a redeploy.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/Hubs/NotesHub.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a NotesHub class that implements a SignalR hub for managing notes.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- AddNote - Handles a request to add a new note. It sends the CreateNoteCommand to MediatR to execute the command. Once complete, it broadcasts the response back to the user who made the request.\\n\\n- GetNotes - Handles a request to get all notes for the current user. It sends the GetAllNotesByUserIdQuery to MediatR to execute the query. Once the notes are retrieved, it broadcasts them back to the caller. \\n\\nThis hub allows clients to:\\n\\n- Add new notes via the AddNote method\\n- Get all notes for the current user via the GetNotes method\\n\\nThe hub acts as a mediator, sending commands/queries to MediatR and broadcasting responses back to clients. This allows real-time updates of notes to be pushed to clients when changes occur via SignalR.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231024211636_user update (login unique).cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a database migration for the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Adds a migration called \\\&quot;user update (login unique)\\\&quot;\\n\\n- The Up method:\\n  - Creates a unique index on the \\\&quot;login\\\&quot; column of the \\\&quot;user\\\&quot; table. This ensures each login value is unique.\\n\\n- The Down method:\\n  - Drops the index that was created in the Up method. This allows reverting the migration if needed.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It\\u0027s a database migration file\\n- The migration adds a unique index to enforce unique login values in the users table \\n- Up method adds the index\\n- Down method removes the index, allowing rollback of the migration\\n\\nThe purpose is to modify the database schema/structure by adding the unique index constraint to the users table through a migration. This helps manage database schema changes in a repeatable way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/Note/NoteUpdateRequest.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a request model for updating a note in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined as a record type, which makes it immutable.\\n\\n- NoteUpdateRequest accepts 3 parameters:\\n\\n  - NoteId - The ID of the note to update\\n\\n  - Content - The updated content of the note (nullable)\\n\\n  - Name - The updated name of the note (nullable)\\n\\n- This defines the shape of the data that needs to be passed when making a request to update a note. The ID is required to identify which note to update, while the content and name are optional fields that can be updated.\\n\\n- It acts as a data transfer object (DTO) - it defines the contract for what data needs to be sent in an update request without any application logic.\\n\\n- Key functions:\\n\\n  - Defines a standard request format for updating a note\\n\\n  - Makes the required/optional fields explicit\\n\\n  - Ensures requests are immutable/well-defined\\n\\n  - Acts as a contract between the client and API for note updates\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a request model that clients can use to send updated note data to the API in a standardized, immutable way for processing the update.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/Authentication/RegisterRequest.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a request model for user registration in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the Diary.Contracts.Authentication namespace, indicating it is related to authentication.\\n\\n- RegisterRequest is a record type, which is a lightweight data class in C#.\\n\\n- It defines the properties needed to register a new user:\\n\\n  - Login - The username \\n  - Password \\n  - Email\\n  - FirstName\\n  - LastName\\n\\n- This model class is used to define the expected shape/properties of the data needed to register a new user. The controller/service would accept an instance of this class as a parameter.\\n\\n- It allows strong typing of the registration request data, rather than using a loose dictionary or dynamic object. \\n\\n- Provides validation of required properties being present on registration requests.\\n\\n- Helps map registration request data to an entity/database model for storage.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the contract/shape for user registration requests received by the API in a strongly typed way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Application.GlobalUsings.g.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an auto-generated file that defines global usings for the Diary.Application project in .NET.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It has the \\u003cauto-generated/\\u003e tag which indicates it is auto-generated and not meant to be manually edited.\\n\\n- It defines a set of \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directives for commonly used namespaces in the project.

It saves any pending changes to the data store and returns the number of rows affected. \\n\\n- It takes a CancellationToken parameter so the save operation can be cancelled if needed.\\n\\nThe purpose of this interface is to:\\n\\n- Encapsulate the unit of work pattern which groups multiple data store operations in a single transaction.\\n\\n- Provide a common contract/API for saving changes that different implementations (like Entity Framework) can implement.\\n\\n- Abstract away the specific data access technology/implementation from the application services. Services only depend on this interface.\\n\\n- Allow switching between different data store implementations without changing application code by using dependency injection.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a common way to save pending changes to the data store in a transactional way while abstracting away the specific persistence technology.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Profile/Queries/GetProfile/GetProfileQuery.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a MediatR query to get a profile.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- GetProfileQuery is a record (immutable class) that defines the query request. It takes a UserId string as a parameter.\\n\\n- It implements IRequest\\u003cT\\u003e where T is the return type ProfileResult. This defines it as a MediatR query.\\n\\n- ProfileResult is defined in a common location and will contain the shape of the returned profile data. \\n\\n- When executed via MediatR, this query will retrieve a profile for the given UserId from some data store/service and map it to a ProfileResult object to return.\\n\\n- The main function is to define the request data shape and return type for retrieving a profile via MediatR. The actual data access logic would be handled in the query handler class.\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n1. Defines the request data shape \\n2. Specifies the return type\\n3. Sets it up to work with MediatR for querying profiles\\n4. The handler would contain the actual data access logic\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/bin/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Infrastructure.deps.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a dependencies.json file that contains information about the dependencies of the Diary.Infrastructure project.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines the target framework (.NET Core 7.0)\\n- Lists all direct and transitive dependencies of the project and their versions\\n- Groups dependencies by package/project type\\n- Provides metadata for each dependency like type, path, SHA hash etc. \\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines the overall dependency graph of the project\\n- Allows restoration of the exact dependency graph via a package restore \\n- Validates integrity of dependencies by comparing hashes \\n- Provides metadata for servicing dependencies like updating packages\\n- Enables tooling to understand dependencies for tasks like compilation, publishing etc.\\n\\nIn summary, it captures all dependency and version information for the project in a machine-readable format.

It\\u0027s important for things like garbage collection, reflection capabilities, and serialization settings.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Persistence/Repositories/UserRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a UserRepository class that implements the IUserRepository interface. It is responsible for performing CRUD operations on Users entities in the database via the DiaryDbContext.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Add - Adds a new Users entity to the database\\n- GetByLogin - Gets a Users entity by their login string \\n- IsLoginExist - Checks if a login already exists in the database\\n- GetByUserId - Gets a Users entity by their unique userId\\n\\nThe repository handles data access to the Users table/entity in the database through the DbContext. It provides methods for common data operations like retrieving, adding and checking for existence of user records. This separates the data access logic from the business/domain logic.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Persistence/Configurations/NoteConfiguration.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains the NoteConfiguration class which is used to configure the Notes entity for use in Entity Framework Core.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Implements IEntityTypeConfiguration\\u003cNotes\\u003e to configure the Notes entity type\\n- Defines the table name for Notes as \\\&quot;Note\\\&quot;\\n- Configures the primary key property Id\\n- Configures other property mappings like Name, Content, CreateDate\\n- Configures the relationship between Notes and User as one-to-many with foreign key on UserId\\n- Configures the many-to-many relationship between Notes and Tags using a join table with composite primary key\\n- Defines the foreign key constraints and cascade deletes for the relationships\\n\\nIn summary, it maps the Notes domain entity and its properties and relationships to the database using Entity Framework conventions and fluent API configuration. This allows Entity Framework to understand how to work with the Notes entity for CRUD operations against the database.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Queries/GetAllByUserId/GetAllNotesByUserIdQueryHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains the handler for the GetAllNotesByUserIdQuery MediatR query.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Handles the GetAllNotesByUserIdQuery request\\n- Retrieves the INoteRepository from the constructor dependency injection\\n- Calls the GetAllByUser method on the note repository, passing in the UserId from the request\\n- Returns the notes collection or an empty list if no notes are found\\n\\nIn summary, it is responsible for handling the GetAllNotesByUserIdQuery query by retrieving all notes for a given user ID from the note repository and returning them. The note repository abstracts the data access layer so this handler is agnostic to the actual data source.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231026220146_update.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a migration for updating the database schema in an Entity Framework Core project.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Drops the foreign key constraint between the Note table and the Calendar table.\\n\\n- Drops the Calendar table. \\n\\n- Renames the CalendarId column in the Note table to UserId. \\n\\n- Renames the index on the Note table that was on the CalendarId column to be on the new UserId column.\\n\\n- Adds a new foreign key constraint between the Note table and the User table on the UserId column, with a cascade delete behavior.\\n\\nSo in summary, it is removing the relationship between notes and calendars, and instead relating each note directly to a user. This changes the data model/schema.\\n\\nThe Up and Down methods allow applying and reverting these changes - Up runs the schema altering code, Down undoes it. This allows incremental deployment of database changes with migrations.\\n\\nSo the key functions are:\\n\\n- Altering the database schema through actions like dropping/adding tables, columns, constraints\\n- Providing a reversible set of changes via Up/Down methods for migrations\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Interfaces/Persistence/INoteRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for a note repository in the persistence layer.\\n\\nThe key functions it defines are:\\n\\n- Add(Notes note) - Adds a new note to the data store\\n- Update(Guid noteId, string? name, string? content) - Updates an existing note by ID \\n- GetById(Guid noteId) - Gets a note by its ID\\n- GetAllByUser(Guid userId) - Gets all notes for a given user ID\\n\\nSome key points:\\n\\n- It is in the Common/Interfaces/Persistence folder, indicating it defines an interface for a persistence layer implementation\\n- It references the Notes domain model class from the Domain project\\n- All methods are asynchronous Task-based methods\\n- The interface defines the basic CRUD operations for notes - Add, Update, GetById, GetAll\\n- This allows different data store implementations (SQL, NoSQL etc) to be plugged in via implementing this interface\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a standard interface for a note data access layer that different data store implementations can implement to provide a consistent way of working with note entities.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Domain.AssemblyInfo.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file (Diary.Domain.AssemblyInfo.cs) contains assembly level attributes for the Diary.Domain assembly.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Provides metadata about the assembly such as company name, product name, version, etc. This metadata is used at runtime.\\n\\n- AssemblyCompanyAttribute specifies the name of the company that produced the assembly.\\n\\n- AssemblyConfigurationAttribute specifies the configuration (e.g. Debug) for the assembly. \\n\\n- AssemblyFileVersionAttribute and AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute specify the file and informational version numbers of the assembly.\\n\\n- AssemblyProductAttribute specifies the name of the product that this assembly is a part of.\\n\\n- AssemblyTitleAttribute specifies the title of the assembly. \\n\\n- AssemblyVersionAttribute specifies the version number of the assembly.\\n\\n- The attributes are used by tools like NuGet to identify the assembly and by the runtime to load the correct assembly.\\n\\n- The file is auto-generated and contains boilerplate code to set the assembly level attributes. It shouldn\\u0027t be manually edited.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides metadata about the assembly for identification and versioning purposes mainly used by tools and runtime.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/Authentication/LoginRequest.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a LoginRequest class that represents a request to log in to the system.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the Diary.Contracts.Authentication namespace, indicating it is related to authentication.\\n\\n- It is a record class, meaning it is immutable and the properties are read-only.\\n\\n- It has two string properties - Login and Password - to represent the login credentials being passed in the request. \\n\\n- LoginRequest is likely used as a parameter type for an authentication service method that handles login requests. The service would validate the credentials and return a result/token if valid.\\n\\n- By defining it as a separate class, the request payload is decoupled from the implementation of the authentication logic. This follows separation of concerns.\\n\\n- It lives in the Contracts project/namespace, so other projects can reference this type to make strongly typed login requests without direct dependency on the authentication implementation.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines an immutable data transfer object to represent a login request payload in a way that is reusable across different projects/layers in a decoupled manner.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/bin/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Application.deps.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a dependencies.json file that contains information about the dependencies of the Diary.Application project.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines the runtime target (.NET Core 7.0)\\n- Lists the direct dependencies of the Diary.Application project (Diary.Contracts, Diary.Domain, MediatR, etc.)\\n- Provides information about each dependency, including:\\n  - Its own dependencies\\n  - The assembly files it contains\\n- Distinguishes between project references and package references\\n- Provides metadata like assembly and file versions for each package\\n- Allows restoring the full dependency graph of the application\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines the project\\u0027s dependency graph \\n- Enables dependency restoration/installation\\n- Provides metadata about each dependency \\n- Distinguishes project vs package references\\n- Supports diagnosing dependency/versioning issues\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the information needed to understand and restore the dependencies of the Diary.Application project.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/DependencyInjection.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is setting up dependency injection for the Diary.Application project.\\n\\nThe key things it is doing:\\n\\n1. Adding MediatR support - MediatR is a library for handling CQRS and mediating requests/commands in .NET apps. This registers MediatR with the dependency injection container.\\n\\n2. Scanning the assembly (the current assembly where this class is defined) and registering any classes that implement IRequestHandler or IRequestPreProcessor interfaces with MediatR. This allows any command/query handlers to be automatically discovered and registered.\\n\\n3. Returning the services collection so that the configuration can be added to the main DI container in the composition root of the application.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Sets up MediatR for handling commands/queries\\n- Automatically discovers and registers command/query handlers \\n- Returns services collection for composition root\\n\\nThis sets up all the plumbing needed for MediatR and command/query handling within this layer of the application in a clean, automatic way via dependency injection.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Profile/Queries/GetProfile/GetProfileQueryHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains the handler for the GetProfileQuery MediatR query in the Diary.Application.Profile.Queries.GetProfile namespace.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Handles the GetProfileQuery request and returns a ProfileResult object\\n- Retrieves the user object from the IUserRepository using the userId from the request\\n- Retrieves the user info object from the IUserInfoRepository using the same userId  \\n- Constructs and returns a ProfileResult containing the user\\u0027s login, email, first name and last name\\n- Throws an exception if either the user or user info objects are null\\n\\nIn summary, it handles the query to get a user\\u0027s profile details by coordinating retrieval of data from the user and user info repositories and assembling it into a ProfileResult response object.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/obj/project.packagespec.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a project.packagespec.json file that is generated by the .NET SDK to store NuGet package restore information for a .NET project.\\n\\nSome key things it does/contains:\\n\\n- Stores information needed to restore NuGet packages for the project, including the project path, target frameworks, package sources, etc. \\n\\n- Identifies the project it is for (Diary.Contracts project in this case)\\n\\n- Specifies the target framework (.NET 7.0)\\n\\n- Lists NuGet package sources to check for packages\\n\\n- Stores framework and project reference information\\n\\n- Specifies fallback folders and assets for restoring packages\\n\\n- Defines warnings to treat as errors during restore\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the configuration needed by the NuGet restore process to download the correct packages for the project based on the packages listed in the project file and restore them to the obj folder. This allows other tools and builds to reference the restored packages without having to perform the restore step themselves.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Interfaces/Persistence/ITagRepository.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for a tag repository in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is defined in the Diary.Application.Common.Interfaces.Persistence namespace, indicating it is an interface for a persistence layer.\\n\\n- It inherits from ITagRepository, indicating it will provide data access functions for Tag domain objects.\\n\\n- The only method defined is Add(Tags tags). This allows adding a new Tags object to the data store via the repository.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a contract/interface for accessing tag data\\n- The repository will handle data access functions for Tag domain objects \\n- Currently it only defines an Add method to insert a new Tags object\\n\\nOther common repository functions it may include are:\\n\\n- Get \\n- GetById\\n- Update\\n- Delete\\n- etc\\n\\nBut at a minimum it exposes an interface for inserting tag data via the persistence layer. Any class implementing this interface can then handle the actual data access/storage.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/obj/project.packagespec.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a project.packagespec.json file that is used by the .NET package restore process.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Stores metadata about the project such as the path, target frameworks, etc. This is used to identify the project during restore.\\n\\n- Defines package sources that will be used to restore packages from, such as NuGet.org.\\n\\n- Specifies project dependencies and references, including other projects in the solution.\\n\\n- Defines the target framework(s) the project supports, in this case .NET 7. \\n\\n- Stores information about package references and dependencies for each target framework.\\n\\n- Specifies restore options like warning properties to treat as errors.\\n\\nThe main functions are:\\n\\n- Identifying the project and its configuration for restore \\n- Defining package sources to restore from\\n- Specifying project and package dependencies\\n- Configuring restore behavior like framework mappings\\n- Providing metadata needed for restore to work correctly\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the configuration needed by the NuGet restore process to correctly restore packages for the project.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Profile/Common/ProfileResult.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a ProfileResult record type that is used to return profile data from the Profile application service in Diary.Application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- ProfileResult is a record type, which means it is a lightweight data class that is immutable and has public read-only properties.\\n\\n- It has properties for the login, email, first name, and last name of a user profile. \\n\\n- This is likely used as the return type from methods in the Profile application service to retrieve and return user profile data in a clean, typed way.\\n\\n- By using a record type, it avoids having to define get-only properties or a constructor - the properties are directly accessible.\\n\\n- This separates the data transfer object (ProfileResult) from the application service logic, keeping things cleanly separated.\\n\\n- ProfileResult serves to encapsulate and transfer profile data between the application and presentation layers in a strongly typed way.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a simple DTO/data transfer object for returning profile data from services in a clean, immutable way without unnecessary boilerplate code.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/appsettings.json\&quot;:\&quot;This appsettings.json file is used to configure settings for an ASP.NET Core API application.\\n\\nKey things it is doing:\\n\\n- Configuring logging levels - it sets the default log level to Information and Microsoft.AspNetCore logs to Warning level. This controls the verbosity of logging output.\\n\\n- Allowing all hosts - the \\\&quot;AllowedHosts\\\&quot; setting with \\\&quot;*\\\&quot; allows requests from any origin. This is common for development but should be restricted in production. \\n\\n- Configuring JWT authentication settings - It sets the secret key used to sign JWT tokens, their expiry time in minutes, and the issuer and audience claims included in the tokens. These are used to implement JWT authentication in the API.\\n\\n- The JWTSettings section allows configuring aspects related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that are likely used for authentication - things like the secret, expiration, and standard claims like issuer and audience.\\n\\nSo in summary, it is setting up logging, CORS/host restrictions, and JWT authentication settings that the API will use via configuration rather than hardcoded values. This makes the settings configurable without recompiling code.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Authentication/JwtTokenGenerator.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file implements the IJwtTokenGenerator interface and contains the logic for generating JWT tokens.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- GenerateToken(): Takes a Users object and generates a JWT token for that user. It:\\n\\n  - Creates the signing credentials using the secret from the JwtSettings\\n\\n  - Creates the claims to put in the token like sub, name, jti\\n\\n  - Creates a new JwtSecurityToken using the claims, signing credentials, issuer, audience, expiration\\n\\n  - Returns the token as a string by writing the JwtSecurityToken\\n\\n- It uses the IDateTimeProvider to get the current UTC time for setting the expiration\\n\\n- It reads the JWT settings like secret, issuer, audience, expiration minutes from the JwtSettings options\\n\\nSo in summary, it generates signed JWT tokens for users by creating the claims, token, and signing it according to the JWT settings.

This allows retrieving the current datetime in a standardized way across the application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It\\u0027s defined in the Common/Interfaces/Services namespace, indicating it\\u0027s a core service interface.\\n\\n- By defining an interface, it allows different implementations of datetime retrieval to be plugged in, like using a mock in tests.\\n\\n- UtcNow returns DateTime rather than a local datetime, making dates consistent regardless of server/client timezone. \\n\\n- Classes needing the current datetime can depend on IDateTimeProvider rather than directly using DateTime.Now, decoupling code from the actual datetime implementation.\\n\\n- Other services, entities, etc. in the app can then be constructed/validated based on the consistent UtcNow value rather than relying on local machine datetime.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a standardized way to retrieve the current UTC datetime across the application in a decoupled, testable manner.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Infrastructure.GlobalUsings.g.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an auto-generated file that defines global usings for the Diary.Infrastructure project in .NET.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It has the \\u003cauto-generated/\\u003e tag which indicates it was generated by the compiler and shouldn\\u0027t be manually edited.\\n\\n- It defines a set of \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directives for commonly used namespaces in the project. This avoids having to fully qualify types from these namespaces everywhere they are used.\\n\\n- The namespaces included are things like System, System.Collections.Generic, System.IO, System.Linq etc. These contain core .NET types.\\n\\n- By defining these as \\\&quot;global using\\\&quot; directives, types from these namespaces can be used without namespace qualification in the rest of the project code.\\n\\n- This helps reduce verbosity and clutter in the code by avoiding things like System.String and instead just using string.\\n\\n- The file is generated at compile/build time based on the project\\u0027s configuration to ensure the global usings are always up to date.\\n\\nSo in summary, this auto-generated file centrally defines common global usings to reduce namespace qualification boilerplate in the rest of the project code. It helps clean up and simplify usage of core .NET types.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Interfaces/Authentication/IJwtTokenGenerator.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines an interface for generating JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- IJwtTokenGenerator is an interface that defines the contract for classes that can generate JWT tokens.\\n\\n- It has a single method GenerateToken that takes a Users domain model object and returns a string containing the generated JWT token.\\n\\n- Classes that implement this interface will contain the actual logic for generating JWT tokens, like signing them with a secret key, setting expiration, etc. \\n\\n- The application services can depend on IJwtTokenGenerator to generate tokens without knowing the actual implementation. This follows the dependency inversion principle.\\n\\n- When a user authenticates, an implementation of this interface would be used to generate their JWT token that gets returned and stored in the client.\\n\\n- The token can then be used for authentication on subsequent requests by verifying the signature and claims in the token.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a contract for JWT token generation that implementation classes can satisfy, abstracting away the actual generation logic from application services.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/appsettings.Development.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an appsettings configuration file for a .NET Core API project. It is used to configure settings for the development environment.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Configures logging levels - it sets the default log level to Information and Microsoft.AspNetCore logs to Warning level. This controls the verbosity of logging output.\\n\\n- Configures JWT (JSON Web Token) settings used for authentication/authorization:\\n\\n  - Secret - The secret key used to sign JWTs \\n  - ExpiryMinutes - How long JWTs remain valid before expiring\\n  - Issuer - The issuer claim in the JWT \\n  - Audience - The audience claim in the JWT\\n\\n- It allows settings to be configured differently for development vs production without changing code. The API will read settings from this file specifically when run in the development environment.\\n\\n- Externalizes configuration details outside of code for easier management. Settings can be changed without redeploying the API.\\n\\n- Provides a single source of configuration truth for the development environment.\\n\\nSo in summary, it handles logging and authentication configuration that varies by environment in a code-free manner for the development environment.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/obj/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Api.AssemblyInfo.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file (Diary.Api.AssemblyInfo.cs) contains assembly level attributes for the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Identifies the user secrets ID used by the project for storing secrets like API keys, passwords etc. This is done via the UserSecretsIdAttribute.\\n\\n- Provides metadata about the assembly like company name, product name, version etc. This is done via attributes like AssemblyCompanyAttribute, AssemblyProductAttribute etc. \\n\\n- Specifies the file version and informational version of the assembly.

This metadata is auto-generated but allows things like assembly identification and versioning.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231024210433_UpdateUsers.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a migration file for Entity Framework Core that updates the Users table in the database.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Up - Contains the logic to apply the migration to the database. In this case, it renames the \\\&quot;nikname\\\&quot; column to \\\&quot;login\\\&quot; in the \\\&quot;user\\\&quot; table.\\n\\n- Down - Contains the logic to roll back the migration if needed. Here it renames the \\\&quot;login\\\&quot; column back to \\\&quot;nikname\\\&quot;. \\n\\n- This migration allows renaming a column in the database table without losing any data. The Up method runs the rename, and Down undoes it if needed.\\n\\n- Migration files allow evolving the database schema over time by applying incremental changes via migrations, instead of having to rebuild the database from scratch.\\n\\n- Entity Framework Core uses these migrations to synchronize the database schema with the code model and apply pending changes to the database on application startup.\\n\\nSo in summary, this migration file updates the database table structure by renaming a column, providing both the forward and backward logic for the change.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231120235445_upddate.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a database migration for the Diary.Infrastructure project.\\n\\nDatabase migrations are used to evolve a database schema over time as the application code changes.

Classes that implement this interface will be able to:\\n\\n- GeneratePassword(string password) - Takes a plain text password and hashes it using a secure hashing algorithm. This is used when a user creates or changes their password.\\n\\n- VerifyPassword(string password, string passwordHash) - Takes a plain text password and an existing hashed password, hashes the plain text and compares the hashes to verify if the password matches. This is used when a user attempts to log in. \\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- GeneratePassword() - Hashes a plain text password for storage \\n- VerifyPassword() - Verifies a plain text password matches an existing hashed password\\n\\nThe purpose of this interface is to abstract away the password hashing logic, so different hashing algorithms/libraries can be used without changing code that relies on password verification/generation. Classes that implement this interface can securely hash and verify passwords.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025175803_upd cascade delete.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a migration file in Entity Framework Core that updates the database schema.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Updates foreign key constraints on some tables to use cascade deletes instead of no action. Specifically:\\n  - Calendar -\\u003e User \\n  - TagNote -\\u003e Note\\n  - TagNote -\\u003e Tag\\n\\n- The Up method:\\n  - Drops the existing foreign key constraints\\n  - Adds new foreign key constraints with ON DELETE CASCADE action\\n\\n- The Down method: \\n  - Drops the foreign key constraints added in Up\\n  - Re-adds the original foreign key constraints without cascade deletes\\n\\nSo in summary, it modifies the database schema to enable cascade deletes on some relationships when records are deleted, to maintain referential integrity. \\n\\nThe Up and Down methods allow applying and reversing the schema change when running EF migrations to update the database.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Commands/Create/CreateNoteCommand.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a command for creating a new note in the diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a CreateNoteCommand class that inherits from IRequest\\u003cNotes\\u003e. IRequest indicates it is a MediatR command that will return a Notes object.\\n\\n- The command takes in the UserId and a CreateNote object. This contains the data needed to create the note (title, content etc). \\n\\n- It uses MediatR for handling commands in an asynchronous way. MediatR is a mediator library that handles passing commands/queries to their handlers.\\n\\n- When handled, this command will create a new note entity using the data passed in and return a Notes object containing the newly created note.\\n\\n- The main function is to define the data contract for creating a new note via a command. This separates the command from the actual note creation logic which would be handled in a separate class.\\n\\n- Keywords:\\n  - MediatR - For asynchronous command handling\\n  - IRequest - Indicates it is a command that returns a result\\n  - CreateNoteCommand - The name of the command class\\n  - UserId, Note - The data needed to create the note\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the data and interface for a command to create a new note in the application.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/bin/Debug/net7.0/appsettings.Development.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an appsettings configuration file used by the Diary.Api project.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Configures logging levels - it sets the default log level to Information and Microsoft.AspNetCore logs to Warning level. This controls the verbosity of logging output.\\n\\n- Configures JWT (JSON Web Token) settings used for authentication/authorization:\\n\\n  - Secret - The secret key used to sign JWTs issued by the API\\n\\n  - ExpiryMinutes - How long JWTs remain valid before expiring\\n\\n  - Issuer - The issuer claim value included in all JWTs\\n\\n  - Audience - The intended audience of the JWTs\\n\\n- This is a development configuration file (appsettings.Development.json) which would be used when running the API locally in development/debug mode. There may be other environment-specific configuration files like appsettings.Production.json.\\n\\n- Provides configuration values that can be injected into the API via the configuration system, rather than having hardcoded values. This makes the configuration customizable and environment-aware.\\n\\nSo in summary, it centrally defines logging and JWT auth settings that the Diary.Api project will use at runtime when in the development environment.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/Tag/Tags.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a Tags class that represents tags in the domain model for a diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a Tags class that will represent tag entities.\\n\\n- Tags have an Id (unique identifier), Name property. \\n\\n- It has a Notes navigation property that represents the collection of Notes associated with this tag. This establishes the many-to-many relationship between Tags and Notes.\\n\\n- The Notes property is of type ICollection\\u003cNotes\\u003e which allows adding/removing notes from the collection.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Stores basic tag properties like Id and Name\\n\\n- Allows associating multiple notes to a tag via the Notes navigation property \\n\\n- Defines the entity that represents tags in the domain model and its relationships to notes\\n\\n- Provides a class for representing tag data that can be used throughout the application\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the Tag entity for the domain model including its properties and relationships to notes, to model tags and their associations with notes in the diary application.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025175803_upd cascade delete.Designer.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a migration file for Entity Framework Core. It is used to update the database schema.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- BuildTargetModel - This method builds the model that represents the target schema for the database. It configures the entities and relationships between them.\\n\\n- HasAnnotation - Adds annotations to the model builder to identify the database context type, migration name, etc. \\n\\n- Entity configuration - Configures the properties and relationships for each entity (tables in the database). Things like primary keys, foreign keys, data types, indexes, etc.\\n\\n- Model relationships - Defines the relationships between entities like one-to-many, many-to-many using Fluent API. Also specifies cascade deletes.\\n\\n- ToTable - Maps the entity to a database table. \\n\\n- HasKey - Specifies the primary key property.\\n\\n- HasIndex - Creates indexes on properties. \\n\\n- HasForeignKey - Configures foreign key properties and relationships. \\n\\n- WithMany/WithOne - Configures the navigation properties for relationships.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the target database schema model that Entity Framework will apply when updating the database during a migration.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/obj/project.assets.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a project.assets.json file that contains metadata about a .NET project and its package references.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Stores information about the project such as name, path, target frameworks etc. This allows the project to be restored correctly.\\n\\n- Defines package folders where NuGet will search for packages. \\n\\n- Lists package sources that NuGet will check for available packages.\\n\\n- Defines target frameworks and dependencies between frameworks.\\n\\n- Records restore information like packages referenced and their versions.\\n\\n- Provides configuration for restore behavior like warning properties. \\n\\n- Allows the project to be restored to the same state by reading and applying the metadata in this file. \\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the metadata needed for NuGet to understand the project, its dependencies and restore it to the correct state with the right package references.

This defines it as a MediatR request.\\n\\n- The query will be handled by a LoginQueryHandler that implements IRequestHandler\\u003cLoginQuery, AuthenticationResult\\u003e. \\n\\n- The handler will perform the login logic - validate credentials, generate auth token etc.\\n\\n- AuthenticationResult is a common response type defined elsewhere to encapsulate the auth result.\\n\\n- Using MediatR/CQRS pattern, this separates the query (request) from the handling logic, keeping the code decoupled and testable.\\n\\n- Clients can make this request by creating a LoginQuery instance and passing it to the Mediator.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the login query request data and shapes the request-response, without containing any handling logic. The actual work is delegated to a separate handler class.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Authentication/Queries/Login/LoginQueryHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains the handler for the LoginQuery MediatR query.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Handle - The main handler method that is called when the LoginQuery is executed. It handles the login workflow:\\n\\n  1. Retrieves the user from the repository by login \\n  2. Validates the password hash matches the provided password\\n  3. Generates a JWT token\\n  4. Returns an AuthenticationResult with the user and token\\n\\n- It depends on:\\n\\n  - IJwtTokenGenerator to generate the JWT token\\n  - IPasswordHasher to validate the password \\n  - IUserRepository to retrieve the user\\n\\nSo in summary, it handles the login business logic - validating the credentials and generating the authentication token if valid. The dependencies allow it to retrieve the user, validate the password, and generate the token.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Contracts/bin/Debug/net7.0/Diary.Contracts.deps.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a dependencies file (.deps.json) that contains metadata about the dependencies of the Diary.Contracts project.\\n\\nSome key things it does/contains:\\n\\n- Defines the runtime target (.NET Core 7.0) that the project targets.\\n\\n- Lists the compilation options used to build the project. \\n\\n- Defines the targets - in this case just .NET Core 7.0.\\n\\n- Lists the assemblies/libraries that are part of the project - in this case just the Diary.Contracts assembly. \\n\\n- Provides metadata about each library like the version, type (project vs package), whether it can be serviced, and a SHA512 hash.\\n\\n- Allows restoring the project and its dependencies by providing information about what libraries the project depends on and what runtime it targets.\\n\\n- Is used by tools like dotnet to resolve, restore and install dependencies when building or running the project.\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains all the metadata needed to describe the dependencies and targets of the project to enable dependency restoration and resolution.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Commands/Create/CreateNoteCommandHandler.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a command handler for creating a new note.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It implements the IRequestHandler interface for the CreateNoteCommand message type. This tells MediatR that this class handles the CreateNoteCommand message.\\n\\n- The constructor injects the INoteRepository and IUnitOfWork interfaces. These will be used to persist the new note to the database.\\n\\n- The Handle method takes the CreateNoteCommand message and request payload as parameters. \\n\\n- It creates a new Notes domain entity and populates it from the command data.\\n\\n- It adds the new note entity to the note repository. \\n\\n- It saves any pending changes to the database by calling SaveChangesAsync on the unit of work. \\n\\n- It returns the created note entity.\\n\\nSo in summary, this command handler is responsible for:\\n\\n1. Mapping the command data to a domain entity\\n2. Persisting the entity to the database \\n3. Returning the created entity\\n\\nIt uses the repository and unit of work patterns to abstract data access.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Domain/obj/Debug/net7.0/.NETCoreApp,Version\\u003dv7.0.AssemblyAttributes.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is an assembly attributes file generated by the .NET compiler.\\n\\nIt contains metadata attributes that are applied to the assembly. The main purpose of this file is to specify the target framework for the assembly.\\n\\nKey functions/attributes:\\n\\n- TargetFrameworkAttribute - Specifies that the target framework for the assembly is .NET Core 7.0. This informs other code/tools which version of .NET the assembly is compiled for.\\n\\n- FrameworkDisplayName - Provides a human-readable name for the target framework, in this case \\\&quot;.NET 7.0\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- Assembly attributes in general provide metadata about the assembly that can be read at runtime via reflection. This includes things like assembly name, version, copyright etc. \\n\\n- The attributes in this file don\\u0027t contain any code - they just annotate the assembly with metadata. This file is auto-generated by the compiler.\\n\\n- Specifying the target framework is important for things like assembly binding/loading, determining what framework-specific APIs can be used, and ensuring compatibility with the correct .NET version.\\n\\nSo in summary, it identifies the target framework metadata for reflection and ensures the assembly is only used in the intended framework version.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Note/Queries/GetAllByUserId/GetAllNotesByUserIdQuery.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a MediatR query to retrieve all notes for a given user ID.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a GetAllNotesByUserIdQuery class that implements IRequest\\u003cICollection\\u003cNotes\\u003e\\u003e. This specifies it is a query that returns a collection of Notes domain objects.\\n\\n- The query takes a UserId Guid parameter to specify which user\\u0027s notes to retrieve. \\n\\n- By implementing IRequest\\u003cTResponse\\u003e, this tells MediatR that an instance of this query class can be sent to the Mediator to execute the query.\\n\\n- The response will be an ICollection\\u003cNotes\\u003e containing all the note domain objects for the given user.\\n\\n- This separates the query definition from the query handling/implementation. Another class (the handler) will actually retrieve the notes from the data store and return them.\\n\\n- Following CQRS/MediatR patterns, this keeps the queries/commands separated from the handling logic and data access code.\\n\\nSo in summary, its key function is to define the query request type for retrieving all notes by user ID, without concerning itself with how the data is retrieved.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Authentication/JwtSettings.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This JwtSettings class is used to configure the JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication settings in the Diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a constant SectionName that will be used to retrieve these settings from the appsettings.json configuration file.\\n\\n- It has properties for the JWT secret, expiration time in minutes, issuer, and audience. These are the main claims needed to generate and validate JWTs.\\n\\n- The properties are initialized using the null-forgiving operator (!) to ensure they are not null.\\n\\n- This class centralizes all the JWT configuration in one place that can be easily accessed.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Stores the JWT secret, expiration, issuer and audience claims needed to generate and validate JWTs.\\n\\n- Allows retrieving the JWT settings from configuration using the SectionName constant. \\n\\n- Centralizes all JWT configuration in one class for easy access throughout the authentication code.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a class to encapsulate and configure the JWT authentication settings for the Diary app in a centralized and accessible way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Api/CustomIdProvider.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This CustomIdProvider class implements the IUserIdProvider interface in SignalR to provide a custom user ID for SignalR connections.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- GetUserId - This method is called by SignalR to get the user ID for a connection. It retrieves the NameIdentifier claim from the HttpContext user to get the user\\u0027s ID.\\n\\n- Implements IUserIdProvider - This interface defines the GetUserId method that SignalR uses to retrieve a unique ID for each user connection. Implementing it allows custom user ID generation.\\n\\n- Uses HttpContext - It gets the HttpContext from the HubConnectionContext to access information about the authenticated user, like claims.\\n\\n- Returns NameIdentifier claim value - This claim typically contains the primary key of the user record, and is used as the unique ID for the user\\u0027s SignalR connections.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a custom user ID provider for SignalR that retrieves the authenticated user\\u0027s ID from an authentication claim, allowing connections to be associated with individual users.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/Migrations/20231025123346_userinfo upd.Designer.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a migration file for Entity Framework Core.

This interface is defined in the Application layer to abstract date/time functionality.\\n\\n- It has a single method called UtcNow that returns the current UTC date/time via DateTime.UtcNow. \\n\\n- This allows any code in the Infrastructure layer that needs the current UTC date/time to simply depend on IDateTimeProvider instead of directly using DateTime.UtcNow.\\n\\n- It follows the Dependency Inversion principle - the Application layer defines the abstraction (IDateTimeProvider) and the Infrastructure layer implements it (DateTimeProvider class).\\n\\n- Provides a way to mock/stub date/time in unit tests by injecting a test double for IDateTimeProvider instead of using the real DateTimeProvider class.\\n\\nSo in summary, it implements a date/time provider interface to abstract date/time functionality and provide the current UTC datetime to other infrastructure classes in a decoupled way.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Application/Common/Note/CreateNote.cs\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a record type for creating notes in the diary application.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- Namespace: Diary.Application.Common.Note - Indicates this is a common note entity for the diary application\\n\\n- CreateNote is a record type - Records are immutable data structures in C#\\n\\n- It has two properties:\\n  - Content - The text content of the note\\n  - Name - The name/title of the note\\n\\n- This record type is used to represent the data needed to create a new note. It encapsulates the minimum required properties (content and name) to create a valid note entity.\\n\\n- Some key functions/purposes:\\n  - Acts as a data transfer object (DTO) - Used to pass note creation data between layers\\n  - Enforces a consistent shape for new note data\\n  - Immutable - Note creation data cannot be modified once instantiated\\n  - Self-documenting - Clearly shows what is needed to create a note\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a simple immutable DTO for representing the data needed to create a new note entity in the diary application. This facilitates passing validated note data between layers.\&quot;,\&quot;/Diary.Infrastructure/obj/Diary.Infrastructure.csproj.nuget.dgspec.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a .nuget.dgspec.json file, which contains dependency and restore information for NuGet packages used in a .NET project.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Stores restore information for each project in the solution, including project path, packages path, NuGet config files, target frameworks, etc. This allows NuGet to restore packages correctly.\\n\\n- Defines the dependencies and versions for each project\\u0027s target frameworks. This specifies which NuGet packages each project requires.\\n\\n- Defines project references between projects in the solution. This allows projects to reference each other. \\n\\n- Specifies NuGet package sources to use during restore, like NuGet.org.\\n\\n- Stores metadata about each project like version number.\\n\\nSo in summary, its main functions are:\\n\\n- Configuring NuGet restore for the solution \\n- Defining package dependencies for each project\\n- Specifying project references between projects\\n- Storing metadata about each project\\n\\nThis file contains all the information NuGet needs to correctly restore packages and manage dependencies across the solution.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
